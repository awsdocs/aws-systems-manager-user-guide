# AWSSupport\-UpgradeWindowsAWSDrivers<a name="automation-awssupport-upgradewindowsawsdrivers"></a>

 **Description** 

The AWSSupport\-UpgradeWindowsAWSDrivers upgrades or repairs storage and network AWS drivers on the specified Amazon EC2 instance\. The document attempts to install the latest versions of AWS drivers online by calling SSM Agent\. If SSM Agent is not contactable, the document can perform an offline installation of the AWS drivers if explicitly requested\. Note: Both the online and offline upgrade will create an AMI before attempting any operations, which will persist after the automation completes\. It is your responsibility to secure access to the AMI, or to delete it\. The online method restarts the instance as part of the upgrade process, while the offline method requires the provided Amazon EC2 instance be stopped and then started\.

**Note**  
This document will fail on a domain controller\. To update AWS PV drivers on a domain controller, see [Upgrade a Domain Controller \(AWS PV Upgrade\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/Upgrading_PV_drivers.html#aws-pv-upgrade-dc)\.

 **Document Type** 

Automation

 **Owner** 

Amazon

 **Platforms** 

Windows

 **Parameters** 
+ InstanceId

  Type: String

  Description: \(Required\) ID of your Amazon EC2 Windows instance\.
+ AllowOffline

  Type: String

  Allowed values: True,False

  Default: False

  Description: \(Optional\) Set it to true if you allow an offline drivers upgrade in case the online installation cannot be performed\. Note: The offline method requires the provided EC2 instance be stopped and then started\. Data stored in instance store volumes will be lost\. The public IP address will change if you are not using an Elastic IP\.
+ SubnetId

  Type: String

  Default: SelectedInstanceSubnet

  Description: \(Optional\) Offline only \- The subnet ID for the EC2Rescue instance used to perform the offline drivers upgrade\. If no subnet ID is specified, Systems Manager Automation will create a new VPC\.
**Important**  
The subnet must be in the same Availability Zone as InstanceId, and it must allow access to the SSM endpoints\.
+ ForceUpgrade

  Type: String

  Allowed values: True,False

  Default: False

  Description: \(Optional\) Offline only \- Set it to true if you allow the offline drivers upgrade to proceed even though your instance already has the latest drivers installed\.
+ AutomationAssumeRole

  Type: String

  Description: \(Optional\) The ARN of the role that allows Automation to perform the actions on your behalf\. If no role is specified, Systems Manager Automation uses your IAM permissions to run this document\.

 **Examples** 

Start the automation

```
aws ssm start-automation-execution --document-name AWSSupport-UpgradeWindowsAWSDrivers --parameters "InstanceId=INSTANCEID"
```

Start the automation and allow an offline upgrade

```
aws ssm start-automation-execution --document-name AWSSupport-UpgradeWindowsAWSDrivers --parameters "InstanceId=INSTANCEID,AllowOffline=True"
```

Retrieve the execution output

```
aws ssm get-automation-execution --automation-execution-id EXECUTIONID --output text --query 'AutomationExecution.Output'
```

 **Required IAM Permissions** 

The EC2 instance receiving the command must at minimum have an IAM role that includes permissions for **ssm:StartAutomationExecution** and **ssm:SendCommand** to run the automation and send the command to the instance, plus **ssm:GetAutomationExecution** to be able to read the automation output\. You can attach the `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore` Amazon managed policy to your IAM role to provide these permissions\. We recommend, however, using the Automation IAM role `AmazonSSMAutomationRole` for this purpose\. For more information, see [Method 2: Use IAM to Configure Roles for Automation](automation-permissions.md)\.

If you are performing an offline upgrade, see the permissions required by [AWSSupport\-StartEC2RescueWorkflow](automation-awssupport-startec2rescueworkflow.md)\.

 **Document Steps** 

1. aws:assertAwsResourceProperty \- Verifies the input instance is Windows\.

1. aws:assertAwsResourceProperty \- Verifies the input instance is a managed instance\. If so, the online upgrade starts, otherwise the offline upgrade is evaluated\.

   1. \(Online upgrade\) If the input instance is a managed instance:

      1. aws:createImage \- Creates an AMI backup\.

      1. aws:createTags \- Tags the AMI backup\.

      1. aws:runCommand \- Installs ENA network driver via AWS\-ConfigureAWSPackage\.

      1. aws:runCommand \- Installs NVMe driver via AWS\-ConfigureAWSPackage\.

      1. aws:runCommand \- Installs AWS PV driver via AWS\-ConfigureAWSPackage\.

   1. \(Offline upgrade\) If the input instance is not a managed instance:

      1. aws:assertAwsResourceProperty \- Verifies the AllowOffline flag is set to True\. If so, the offline upgrade starts, otherwise the workflow ends\.

      1. aws:changeInstanceState \- Stop the source instance\.

      1. aws:changeInstanceState \- Force\-stop the source instance\.

      1. aws:createImage \- Create an AMI backup of the source instance\.

      1. aws:createTags \- Tag the AMI backup of the source instance\.

      1. aws:executeAwsApi \- Enable ENA for the instance

      1. aws:assertAwsResourceProperty \- Assert the ForceUpgrade flag\.

      1. Force offline upgrade\) If **ForceUpgrade = True** then run aws:executeAutomation to invoke AWSSupport\-StartEC2RescueWorkflow with the drivers force upgrade script\. This installs the drivers regardless of the current version that is installed

      1. \(Offline upgrade\) If **ForceUpgrade = False** then run aws:executeAutomation to invoke AWSSupport\-StartEC2RescueWorkflow with the drivers upgrade script\.
