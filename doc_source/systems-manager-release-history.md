|  GitHub and Amazon S3 Integration  |  **Run remote scripts**: Systems Manager now supports downloading and running scripts from a private or public GitHub repository, and from Amazon S3\. Using either the `AWS-RunRemoteScript` pre\-defined SSM document or the `aws:downloadContent` plugin in a custom SSM document, you can run Ansible Playbooks and scripts in Python, Ruby, or PowerShell, to name a few\. These changes further enhance *infrastructure as code* when you use Systems Manager to automate configuration and deployment of Amazon EC2 instances and on\-premises managed instances in your hybrid environment\. For more information, see [Partner and Product Integration](systems-manager-integration.md)\. **Create composite SSM documents**: Systems Manager now supports running one or more secondary SSM documents from a primary SSM document\. These primary documents that run other documents are called *composite* documents\. Composite documents enable you to create and share a standard set of secondary SSM documents across AWS accounts for common tasks such as boot\-strapping anti\-virus software or domain\-joining instances\. You can run composite and secondary documents stored in Systems Manager, GitHub, or Amazon S3\. After you create a composite document, you can run it by using the `AWS-RunDocument` pre\-defined SSM document\. For more information, see [Creating Composite Documents](composite-docs.md) and [Running Documents from Remote Locations](run-remote-documents.md)\. **SSM document plugin reference**: For easier access, we moved the SSM Plugin Reference for SSM documents out of the Systems Manager API Reference and into the User Guide\. For more information, see [SSM Document Plugin Reference](ssm-plugins.md)\.   | October 26, 2017 | 
|  Support for Parameter Versions in Parameter Store  |  When you edit a parameter, Parameter Store now automatically iterates the version number by 1\.
