# Document History<a name="systems-manager-release-history"></a>

The following table describes the important changes to the documentation since the last release of AWS Systems Manager\. For notification about updates to this documentation, you can subscribe to an RSS feed\.

**Important**  
An updated version of SSM Agent is released whenever new capabilities are added to Systems Manager or updates are made to existing capabilities\. If an older version of the agent is running on an instance, some SSM Agent processes can fail\. For that reason, we recommend that you automate the process of keeping SSM Agent up\-to\-date on your instances\. For information, see [Automate Updates to SSM Agent](ssm-agent-automatic-updates.md)\. To be notified about SSM Agent updates, subscribe to the [SSM Agent Release Notes](https://github.com/aws/amazon-ssm-agent/blob/master/RELEASENOTES.md) page on GitHub\.
