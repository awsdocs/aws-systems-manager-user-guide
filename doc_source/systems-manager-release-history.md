# Document history<a name="systems-manager-release-history"></a>

The following table describes the important changes to the documentation since the last release of AWS Systems Manager\. For notification about updates to this documentation, you can subscribe to an RSS feed\.

**Important**  
An updated version of SSM Agent is released whenever new capabilities are added to Systems Manager or updates are made to existing capabilities\. Failing to use the latest version of the agent can prevent your managed node from using various Systems Manager capabilities and features\. For that reason, we recommend that you automate the process of keeping SSM Agent up to date on your machines\. For information, see [Automating updates to SSM Agent](ssm-agent-automatic-updates.md)\. Subscribe to the [SSM Agent Release Notes](https://github.com/aws/amazon-ssm-agent/blob/mainline/RELEASENOTES.md) page on GitHub to get notifications about SSM Agent updates\.

These changes further enhance *infrastructure as code* when you use Systems Manager to automate configuration and deployment of EC2 instances and on\-premises managed instances in your hybrid environment\. For more information, see [Running scripts from GitHub](integration-remote-scripts.md) and [Running scripts from Amazon S3](integration-s3.md)\. **Create composite SSM documents**: Systems Manager now supports running one or more secondary SSM documents from a primary SSM document\. These primary documents that run other documents are called *composite* documents\. Composite documents allow you to create and share a standard set of secondary SSM documents across AWS accounts for common tasks such as boot\-strapping anti\-virus software or domain\-joining instances\. You can run composite and secondary documents stored in Systems Manager, GitHub, or Amazon S3\. After you create a composite document, you can run it by using the `AWS-RunDocument` pre\-defined SSM document\. For more information, see [Creating composite documents](documents-creating-content.md#documents-creating-composite) and [Running documents from remote locations](documents-running-remote-github-s3.md)\. **SSM document plugin reference**: For easier access, we moved the SSM Plugin Reference for SSM documents out of the Systems Manager API Reference and into the User Guide\.
