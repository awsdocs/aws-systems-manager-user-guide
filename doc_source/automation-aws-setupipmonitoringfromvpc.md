# AWSSupport\-SetupIPMonitoringFromVPC<a name="automation-aws-setupipmonitoringfromvpc"></a>

**Description**

AWSSupport\-SetupIPMonitoringFromVPC creates an Amazon EC2 instance in the specified subnet and monitors selected target IPs \(IPv4 or IPv6\) by continuously running ping, MTR, traceroute and tracetcp tests\. The results are stored in Amazon CloudWatch Logs logs, and metric filters are applied to quickly visualize latency and packet loss statistics in a CloudWatch dashboard\.

**Additional Information**

The CloudWatch Logs data can be used for network troubleshooting and analysis of pattern/trends\. Additionally, you can configure CloudWatch alarms with Amazon SNS notifications when packet loss and/or latency reach a threshold\. The data can also be used when opening a Premium Support case, to help isolate an issue quickly and reduce time to resolution when investigating a network issue\.

**Note**  
To clean up resources created by AWSSupport\-SetupIPMonitoringFromVPC, you can run the Automation document `AWSSupport-TerminateIPMonitoringFromVPC`\. For more information, see [AWSSupport\-TerminateIPMonitoringFromVPC](automation-awssupport-terminateipmonitoringfromvpc.md)\.

**Document Type**

Automation

**Owner**

Amazon

**Parameters**
+ SubnetId

  Type: String

  Description: \(Required\) The subnet ID for the monitor instance\. Be aware that if you specify a private subnet, then you must make sure there is Internet access to allow the monitor instance to setup the test \(meaning, install the CloudWatch Logs agent, interact with Systems Manager and CloudWatch\)\.
+ TargetIPs

  Type: String

  Description: \(Required\) Comma separated list of IPv4s and/or IPv6s to monitor\. No spaces allowed\. Maximum size is 255 characters\. Be aware that if you provide an invalid IP, then the automation will fail and rollback the test setup\.
+ CloudWatchLogGroupNamePrefix

  Type: String

  Default: /AWSSupport\-SetupIPMonitoringFromVPC

  Description: \(Optional\) Prefix used for each CloudWatch log group created for the test results\.
+ CloudWatchLogGroupRetentionInDays

  Type: String

  Allowed values: 1,3,5,7,14,30,60,90,120,150,180,365,400,545,731,1827,3653

  Default: 7

  Description: \(Optional\) Number of days you want to keep the network monitoring results for\.
+ InstanceType

  Type: String

  Allowed values: t2\.micro, t2\.small,t2\.medium,t2\.large

  Default: t2\.micro

  Description: \(Optional\) The Amazon EC2 instance type for the EC2Rescue instance\. Recommended size: t2\.micro\.
+ AutomationAssumeRole

  Type: String

  Description: \(Optional\) The AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) role for this execution\. If no role is specified, then Systems Manager Automation uses the permissions of the user that runs this document\.

**Examples**

Start the automation

```
aws ssm start-automation-execution --document-name AWSSupport-SetupIPMonitoringFromVPC --parameters 'SubnetId=SUBNETID,TargetIPs="IPV41,IPV42,IPV61"'
```

Retrieve the execution output

```
aws ssm get-automation-execution --automation-execution-id EXECUTIONID --output text --query 'AutomationExecution.Output'
```

**Required IAM Permissions**

It is recommended that the user who runs the automation have the **AmazonSSMAutomationRole** IAM managed policy attached\. In addition, the user must have the following policy attached to their user account, group, or role:
