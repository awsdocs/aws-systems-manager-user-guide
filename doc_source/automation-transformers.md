# Walkthrough: Using Input Transformers with Automation<a name="automation-transformers"></a>

This Systems Manager Automation walkthrough shows how to use the input transformer feature of Amazon CloudWatch Events to extract the `instance-id` of an Amazon EC2 instance from an instance state change event\. We use the input transformer to pass that data to the `AWS-CreateImage` Systems Manager Automation document target as the `InstanceId` input parameter\. The rule is triggered when any instance changes to the `stopped` state\.

For more information about working with input transformers, see [Tutorial: Use Input Transformer to Customize What is Passed to the Event Target](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/CloudWatch-Events-Input-Transformer-Tutorial.html)\.

**Before You Begin**  
Verify that you added the required permissions and trust policy for CloudWatch Events to your Systems Manager Automation service role\. For more information, see [Overview of Managing Access Permissions to Your CloudWatch Events Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/iam-access-control-identity-based-cwe.html)\.
