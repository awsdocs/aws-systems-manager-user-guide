# `aws:executeAwsApi` â€“ Call and run AWS API operations<a name="automation-action-executeAwsApi"></a>

Calls and runs AWS API operations\. Most API operations are supported, although not all API operations have been tested\. Streaming API operations, such as the [GetObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTObjectGET.html) operation, aren't supported\. If you're not sure if an API operation you want to use is a streaming operation, review the [Boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/index.html) documentation for the service to determine if an API requires streaming inputs\. We regularly update the Boto3 version used by this action\. However, following the release of a new Boto3 version it can take up to a few weeks for changes to be reflected in this action\. Each `aws:executeAwsApi` action can run up to a maximum duration of 25 seconds\. For more examples of how to use this action, see [Additional runbook examples](automation-document-examples.md)\.

**Inputs**  
Inputs are defined by the API operation that you choose\.

Service  
The AWS service namespace that contains the API operation that you want to run\. You can view a list of supported AWS service namespaces in [Available services](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/index.html) of the AWS SDK for Python \(Boto3\)\.

Type: String  
Required: Yes

Api  
The name of the API operation that you want to run\. You can view the API operations \(also called methods\) by choosing a service in the left navigation on the following [Services Reference](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/index.html) page\. Choose a method in the **Client** section for the service that you want to invoke\. For example, all API operations \(methods\) for Amazon Relational Database Service \(Amazon RDS\) are listed on the following page: [Amazon RDS methods](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/rds.html)\.  
Type: String

Choose a method in the **Client** section for the service that you want to invoke\. For example, all methods for Amazon RDS are listed on the following page: [Amazon RDS methods](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/rds.html)\. Choose the [describe\_db\_instances](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/rds.html#RDS.Client.describe_db_instances) method and scroll down to see the available parameters, such as **DBInstanceIdentifier**, **Name**, and **Values**\.  

```
inputs:
  Service: The official namespace of the service
  Api: The API operation name
  API input 1: A value
  API Input 2: A value
  API Input 3: A value
