# aws:executeAwsApi â€“ Call and run AWS API actions<a name="automation-action-executeAwsApi"></a>

Calls and runs AWS API actions\. Most API actions are supported, although not all API actions have been tested\. For example, the following API actions are supported: [CreateImage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_CreateImage.html), [Delete bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTBucketDELETE.html), [RebootDBInstance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_RebootDBInstance.html), and [CreateGroups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_CreateGroup.html), to name a few\. Streaming API actions, such as the [Get Object](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTObjectGET.html) action, aren't supported\. For more information and examples of how to use this action, see [Invoking Other AWS Services from a Systems Manager Automation Workflow](automation-aws-apis-calling.md)\.
