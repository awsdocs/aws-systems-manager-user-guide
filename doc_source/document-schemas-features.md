# SSM Document Schemas and Features<a name="document-schemas-features"></a>

Systems Manager documents currently use the following schema versions\.
+ Documents of type `Command` can use schema version 1\.2, 2\.0, and 2\.2\. If you are currently using schema 1\.2 documents, we recommend that you create documents that use schema version 2\.2\.
+ Documents of type `Policy` must use schema version 2\.0 or later\.
+ Documents of type `Automation` must use schema version 0\.3\. For information, see [Automation Document Schema and Syntax](automation-doc-syntax.md)\.
+ You can create documents in JSON or YAML\.

By using the latest schema version for `Command` and `Policy` documents, you can take advantage of the following features\.


**Schema Version 2\.2 Document Features**  

| Feature | Details | 
| --- | --- | 
|  Document editing  |  Documents can now be updated\. With version 1\.2, any update to a document required that you save it with a different name\.  | 
|  Automatic versioning  |  Any update to a document creates a new version\. This is not a schema version, but a version of the document\.  | 
|  Default version  |  If you have multiple versions of a document, you can specify which version is the default document\.  | 
|  Sequencing  |  Plugins or *steps* in a document run in the order that you specified\.  | 
|  Cross\-platform support  |  Cross\-platform support enables you to specify different operating systems for different plugins within the same SSM document\. Cross\-platform support uses the `precondition` parameter within a step\.   | 

**Note**  
You must keep SSM Agent on your instances updated with the latest version to use new Systems Manager features and SSM document features\. For more information, see [Update SSM Agent by using Run Command](rc-console.md#rc-console-agentexample)\.

The following table lists the differences between major schema versions\.


****  

| Version 1\.2 | Version 2\.2 \(latest version\) | Details | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
|  runtimeConfig  |  mainSteps  |  In version 2\.2, the `mainSteps` section replaces `runtimeConfig`\. The `mainSteps` section enables Systems Manager to run steps in sequence\.  | 
|  properties  |  inputs  |  In version 2\.2, the `inputs` section replaces the `properties` section\. The `inputs` section accepts parameters for steps\.  | 
|  commands  |  runCommand  |  In version 2\.2, the `inputs` section takes the `runCommand` parameter instead of the `commands` parameter\.  | 
|  id  |  action  |  In version 2\.2, `Action` replaces `ID`\. This is just a name change\.  | 
|  not applicable  |  name  |  In version 2\.2, `name` is any user\-defined name for a step\.  | 

**Using the Precondition Parameter**  
With schema version 2\.2 or later, you can use the `precondition` parameter to specify the target operating system for each plugin\. The `precondition` parameter supports `platformType` and a value of either `Windows` or `Linux`\.

For documents that use schema version 2\.2 or later, if `precondition` is not specified, each plugin is either run or skipped based on the pluginâ€™s compatibility with the operating system\. For documents that use schema 2\.0 or earlier, incompatible plugins throw an error\.

For example, in a schema version 2\.2 document, if `precondition` is not specified and the `aws:runShellScript` plugin is listed, then the step runs on Linux instances, but the system skips it on Windows instances because the `aws:runShellScript` is not compatible with Windows instances\. However, for a schema version 2\.0 document, if you specify the `aws:runShellScript` plugin, and then run the document on a Windows instances, the execution fails\. You can see an example of the precondition parameter in an SSM document later in this section\.
