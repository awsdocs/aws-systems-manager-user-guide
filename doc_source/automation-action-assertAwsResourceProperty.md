# aws:assertAwsResourceProperty â€“ Assert an AWS resource state or event state<a name="automation-action-assertAwsResourceProperty"></a>

The aws:assertAwsResourceProperty action enables you to assert a specific resource state or event state for a specific Automation step\. For example, you can specify that an Automation step must wait for an Amazon EC2 instance to start\. Then it will call the Amazon EC2 [DescribeInstanceStatus](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeInstanceStatus.html) API action with the DesiredValue property of `running`\. This ensures that the Automation workflow waits for a running instance and then continues when the instance is, in fact, running\.

For more information and examples of how to use this action, see [Invoking Other AWS Services from a Systems Manager Automation Workflow](automation-aws-apis-calling.md)\.

**Note**  
The default timeout value for this action is 3600 seconds \(one hour\)\. You can limit or extend the timeout by specifying the `timeoutSeconds` parameter for an `aws:waitForAwsResourceProperty` step\.

**Input**  
Inputs are defined by the API action that you choose\.

Service  
The AWS service namespace that contains the API action that you want to run\. For example, the namespace for Systems Manager is `ssm`\. The namespace for Amazon EC2 is `ec2`\. You can view a list of supported AWS service namespaces in the [Available Services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/#available-services) section of the *AWS CLI Command Reference*\.  
Type: String  
Required: Yes

Api  
The name of the API action that you want to run\. You can view the API actions \(also called methods\) by choosing a service in the left navigation on the following [Services Reference](http://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/index.html) page\. Choose a method in the **Client** section for the service that you want to invoke\. For example, all API actions \(methods\) for Amazon Relational Database Service \(Amazon RDS\) are listed on the following page: [Amazon RDS methods](http://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/rds.html)\.  
Type: String  
Required: Yes

API action inputs  
One or more API action inputs\. You can view the available inputs \(also called parameters\) by choosing a service in the left navigation on the following [Services Reference](http://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/index.html) page\. Choose a method in the **Client** section for the service that you want to invoke\. For example, all methods for Amazon RDS are listed on the following page: [Amazon RDS methods](http://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/rds.html)\. Choose the [describe\_db\_instances](http://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/rds.html#RDS.Client.describe_db_instances) method and scroll down to see the available parameters, such as **DBInstanceIdentifier**, **Name**, and **Values**\. Use the following format to specify more than one input\.  

```
inputs:
  Service: The official namespace of the service
  Api: The API action name
  API input 1: A value
  API Input 2: A value
  API Input 3: A value
```

```
"inputs":{
      "Service":"The official namespace of the service",
      "Api":"The API action name",
      "API input 1":"A value",
      "API Input 2":"A value",
      "API Input 3":"A value"
}
```
Type: Determined by chosen API action  
Required: Yes

PropertySelector  
The JSONPath to a specific attribute in the response object\. You can view the response objects by choosing a service in the left navigation on the following [Services Reference](http://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/index.html) page\.

Choose the [describe\_db\_instances](http://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/rds.html#RDS.Client.describe_db_instances) method and scroll down to the **Response Structure** section\. **DBInstances** is listed as a response object\.  
Type: Integer, Boolean, String, StringList, StringMap, or MapList  
Required: Yes

DesiredValues  
The expected status or state on which to continue the Automation workflow\. If you specify a Boolean value, you must use a capital letter such as True or False\.
