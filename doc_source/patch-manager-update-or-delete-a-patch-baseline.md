You can update or delete a custom patch baseline that you have created in Patch Manager, a capability of AWS Systems Manager\. When you update a patch baseline, you can change its name or description, its approval rules, and its exceptions for approved and rejected patches\. You can also update the tags that are applied to the patch baseline\. You can't change the operating system type that a patch baseline has been created for, and you can't make changes to a predefined patch baseline provided by AWS\.

Follow these steps to update or delete a patch baseline\.

**Important**  
 Use caution when deleting a custom patch baseline that might be used by a patch policy configuration in Quick Setup\.  
If you are using a [patch policy configuration](patch-manager-policies.md) in Quick Setup, updates you make to custom patch baselines are synchronized with Quick Setup once an hour\.   
If a custom patch baseline that was referenced in a patch policy is deleted, a banner displays on the Quick Setup **Configuration details** page for your patch policy\. The banner informs you that the patch policy references a patch baseline that no longer exists, and that subsequent patching operations will fail\. In this case, return to the Quick Setup **Configurations** page, select the Patch Manager configuration , and choose **Actions**, **Edit configuration**\. The deleted patch baseline name is highlighted, and you must select a new patch baseline for the affected operating system\.
