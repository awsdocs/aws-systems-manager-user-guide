# Logging session activity<a name="session-manager-logging"></a>

In addition to providing information about current and completed sessions in the Systems Manager console, Session Manager provides you with options for logging session activity in your AWS account\. This allows you to do the following:
+ Create and store session logs for archival purposes\.
+ Generate a report showing details of every connection made to your managed nodes using Session Manager over the past 30 days\.
+ Generate notifications of session activity in your AWS account, such as Amazon Simple Notification Service \(Amazon SNS\) notifications\.
+ Automatically initiate another action on an AWS resource as the result of session activity, such as running an AWS Lambda function, starting an AWS CodePipeline pipeline, or running an AWS Systems Manager Run Command document\.

**Important**  
Take note of the following requirements and limitations for Session Manager:  
Session Manager logs the commands you enter and their output during a session depending on your session preferences\. To prevent sensitive data, such as passwords, from being viewed in your session logs we recommend using the following commands when entering sensitive data during a session\.  

  ```
  stty -echo; read passwd; stty echo;
  ```

  ```
  $Passwd = Read-Host -AsSecureString
  ```
If you're using Windows Server 2012 or earlier, the data in your logs might not be formatted optimally\. We recommend using Windows Server 2012 R2 and later for optimal log formats\.
If you're using Linux or macOS managed nodes, ensure that the screen utility is installed\. If it isn't, your log data might be truncated\. On Amazon Linux, Amazon Linux 2, and Ubuntu Server, the screen utility is installed by default\. To install screen manually, depending on your version of Linux, run either `sudo yum install screen` or `sudo apt-get install screen`\.
Logging isn't available for Session Manager sessions that connect through port forwarding or SSH\. This is because SSH encrypts all session data, and Session Manager only serves as a tunnel for SSH connections\.

For more information about the permissions required to use Amazon S3 or Amazon CloudWatch Logs for logging session data, see [Creating an IAM role with permissions for Session Manager and Amazon S3 and CloudWatch Logs \(console\)](getting-started-create-iam-instance-profile.md#create-iam-instance-profile-ssn-logging)\.

## Streaming session data using Amazon CloudWatch Logs \(console\)<a name="session-manager-logging-cwl-streaming"></a>

You can send a continual stream of session data logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs\. Essential details, such as the commands a user has run in a session, the ID of the user who ran the commands, and timestamps for when the session data is streamed to CloudWatch Logs, are included when streaming session data\. When streaming session data, the logs are JSON\-formatted to help you integrate with your existing logging solutions\. Streaming session data isn't supported for interactive commands\.

**Note**  
To stream session data from Windows Server managed nodes, you must have PowerShell 5\.1 or later installed\. By default, Windows Server 2016 and later have the required PowerShell version installed\. However, Windows Server 2012 and 2012 R2 don't have the required PowerShell version installed by default\. If you haven't already updated PowerShell on your Windows Server 2012 or 2012 R2 managed nodes, you can do so using Run Command\. For information about updating PowerShell using Run Command, see [Updating PowerShell using Run Command](run-command-tutorial-update-software.md#rc-console-pwshexample)\.

**Important**  
If you have the **PowerShell Transcription** policy setting configured on your Windows Server managed nodes, you won't be able to stream session data\.

**To stream session data using Amazon CloudWatch Logs \(console\)**

1. Open the AWS Systems Manager console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/systems\-manager/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Session Manager**\.

1. Choose the **Preferences** tab, and then choose **Edit**\.

1. Select the check box next to **Enable** under **CloudWatch logging**\.

1. Choose the **Stream session logs** option\.

1. \(Recommended\) Select the check box next to **Allow only encrypted CloudWatch log groups**\. With this option turned on, log data is encrypted using the server\-side encryption key specified for the log group\. If you don't want to encrypt the log data that is sent to CloudWatch Logs, clear the check box\. You must also clear the check box if encryption isn't allowed on the log group\.

1. For **CloudWatch logs**, to specify the existing CloudWatch Logs log group in your AWS account to upload session logs to, select one of the following:
   + Enter the name of a log group in the text box that has already been created in your account to store session log data\.
   + **Browse log groups**: Select a log group that has already been created in your account to store session log data\.

1. Choose **Save**\.

## Logging session data using Amazon S3 \(console\)<a name="session-manager-logging-s3"></a>

You can choose to store session log data in a specified Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\) bucket for debugging and troubleshooting purposes\. The default option is for logs to be sent to an encrypted Amazon S3 bucket\. Encryption is performed using the key specified for the bucket, either an AWS KMS key or an Amazon S3 Server\-Side Encryption \(SSE\) key \(AES\-256\)\. 

**Important**  
When you use virtual hosted–style buckets with Secure Sockets Layer \(SSL\), the SSL wildcard certificate only matches buckets that don't contain periods\. To work around this, use HTTP or write your own certificate verification logic\. We recommend that you don't use periods \("\."\) in bucket names when using virtual hosted–style buckets\.

**Amazon S3 bucket encryption**  
In order to send logs to your Amazon S3 bucket with encryption, encryption must be allowed on the bucket\. For more information about Amazon S3 bucket encryption, see [Amazon S3 Default Encryption for S3 Buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/bucket-encryption.html)\.

**Customer managed key**  
If you're using a KMS key that you manage yourself to encrypt your bucket, then the IAM instance profile attached to your instances must have explicit permissions to read the key\. If you use an AWS managed key, the instance doesn't require this explicit permission\. For more information about providing the instance profile with access to use the key, see [Allows Key Users to Use the key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html#key-policy-default-allow-users) in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide*\.

Follow these steps to configure Session Manager to store session logs in an Amazon S3 bucket\.

**Note**  
You can also use the AWS CLI to specify or change the Amazon S3 bucket that session data is sent to\. For information, see [Update Session Manager preferences \(command line\)](getting-started-configure-preferences-cli.md)\.
