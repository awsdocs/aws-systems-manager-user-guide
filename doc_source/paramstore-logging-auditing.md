# Auditing and logging Parameter Store activity<a name="paramstore-logging-auditing"></a>

AWS CloudTrail captures API calls made in the AWS Systems Manager console, the AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\), and the Systems Manager SDK\. You can view the information in the CloudTrail console or in an Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\) bucket\. One bucket is used for all CloudTrail logs for your account\.

Logs of Parameter Store actions show create, update, and delete OpsItem activities\. For more information about viewing and using CloudTrail logs of Systems Manager activity, see [Logging AWS Systems Manager API calls with AWS CloudTrail](monitoring-cloudtrail-logs.md)\.
