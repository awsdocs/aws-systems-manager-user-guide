# Step 2: Create an Admin IAM User for AWS<a name="setup-create-admin-user"></a>

 When you first create an AWS account, you begin with a single sign\-in identity that has complete access to all AWS services and resources in the account\. This identity is called the AWS account *root user* and is accessed by signing in with the email address and password that you used to create the account\. We strongly recommend that you **do not use the root user for your everyday tasks**, even the administrative ones\. Instead, adhere to the [best practice of using the root user only to create your first IAM user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#create-iam-users)\. Then securely lock away the root user credentials and use them to perform only a few account and service management tasks\.

In this procedure, you use the AWS account root user to create your first user in AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\)\. You add this IAM user to an Administrators group, to ensure that you have access to all services and their resources in your account\. The next time that you access your AWS account, you should sign in with the credentials for this IAM user\.

To create an IAM user with limited permissions, see [Step 3: Create Non\-Admin IAM Users and Groups for Systems Manager](setup-create-iam-user.md)\.

**To create an IAM user for yourself and add the user to an Administrators group**

1. Use your AWS account email address and password to sign in as the *[AWS account root user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_root-user.html)* to the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\.
**Note**  
We strongly recommend that you adhere to the best practice of using the **Administrator** IAM user below and securely lock away the root user credentials\. Sign in as the root user only to perform a few [account and service management tasks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tasks-that-require-root.html)\.

1. In the navigation pane of the console, choose **Users**, and then choose **Add user**\.

1. For **User name**, type **Administrator**\.

1. Select the check box next to **AWS Management Console access**, select **Custom password**, and then type the new user's password in the text box\. You can optionally select **Require password reset** to force the user to create a new password the next time the user signs in\.

1. Choose **Next: Permissions**\.

1. On the **Set permissions** page, choose **Add user to group**\.

1. Choose **Create group**\.

1. In the **Create group** dialog box, for **Group name** type **Administrators**\.

1. For **Filter policies**, select the check box for **AWS managed \- job function**\.

1. In the policy list, select the check box for **AdministratorAccess**\. Then choose **Create group**\.

1. Back in the list of groups, select the check box for your new group\. Choose **Refresh** if necessary to see the group in the list\.

1. Choose **Next: Tags** to add metadata to the user by attaching tags as key\-value pairs\.

1. Choose **Next: Review** to see the list of group memberships to be added to the new user\. When you are ready to proceed, choose **Create user**\.

You can use this same process to create more groups and users, and to give your users access to your AWS account resources\. To learn about using policies to restrict users' permissions to specific AWS resources, go to [Access Management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access.html) and [Example Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_examples.html)\.
