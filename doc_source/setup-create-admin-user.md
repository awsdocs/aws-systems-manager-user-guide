# Step 2: Create an Admin IAM user for AWS<a name="setup-create-admin-user"></a>

  When you create an AWS account, you begin with one sign\-in identity that has complete access to all AWS services and resources in the account\. This identity is called the AWS account *root user* and is accessed by signing in with the email address and password that you used to create the account\. We strongly recommend that you do not use the root user for your everyday tasks\. Safeguard your root user credentials and use them to perform the tasks that only the root user can perform\. For the complete list of tasks that require you to sign in as the root user, see [Tasks that require root user credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/root-vs-iam.html#aws_tasks-that-require-root) in the *AWS General Reference*\. 

In this procedure, you use the AWS account root user to create your first user in AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\)\. You add this IAM user to an Administrators group, to ensure that you have access to all services and their resources in your account\. The next time that you access your AWS account, you should sign in with the credentials for this IAM user\. As a best practice, create only the credentials that the user needs\. For example, for a user who requires access only through the AWS Management Console, do not create access keys\. Optionally, you can configure [multi\-factor authentication \(MFA\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa.html) for the user\. MFA requires the user to provide a one\-time\-use code each time he or she signs into the AWS Management Console\.

To create an IAM user with restricted permissions, see [Step 3: Create non\-Admin IAM users and groups for Systems Manager](setup-create-iam-user.md)\.

**To create an administrator user for yourself and add the user to an administrators group \(console\)**

1. Sign in to the [IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/) as the account owner by choosing **Root user** and entering your AWS account email address\. On the next page, enter your password\.
**Note**  
We strongly recommend that you adhere to the best practice of using the **Administrator** IAM user that follows and securely lock away the root user credentials\. Sign in as the root user only to perform a few [account and service management tasks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tasks-that-require-root.html)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Users** and then choose **Add users**\.

1. For **User name**, enter **Administrator**\.

1. Select the check box next to **AWS Management Console access**\. Then select **Custom password**, and then enter your new password in the text box\.

1. \(Optional\) By default, AWS requires the new user to create a new password when first signing in\. You can clear the check box next to **User must create a new password at next sign\-in** to allow the new user to reset their password after they sign in\.

1. Choose **Next: Permissions**\.

1. Under **Set permissions**, choose **Add user to group**\.

1. Choose **Create group**\.

1. In the **Create group** dialog box, for **Group name** enter **Administrators**\.

1. Choose **Filter policies**, and then select **AWS managed \- job function** to filter the table contents\.

1. In the policy list, select the check box for **AdministratorAccess**\. Then choose **Create group**\.
**Note**  
You must activate IAM user and role access to Billing before you can use the `AdministratorAccess` permissions to access the AWS Billing and Cost Management console\. To do this, follow the instructions in [step 1 of the tutorial about delegating access to the billing console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_billing.html)\.

1. Back in the list of groups, select the check box for your new group\. Choose **Refresh** if necessary to see the group in the list\.

1. Choose **Next: Tags**\.

1. \(Optional\) Add metadata to the user by attaching tags as key\-value pairs\. For more information about using tags in IAM, see [Tagging IAM entities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

1. Choose **Next: Review** to see the list of group memberships to be added to the new user\. When you are ready to proceed, choose **Create user**\.

You can use this same process to create more groups and users and to give your users access to your AWS account resources\. To learn about using policies that restrict user permissions to specific AWS resources, see [Access management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access.html) and [Example policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_examples.html)\.
