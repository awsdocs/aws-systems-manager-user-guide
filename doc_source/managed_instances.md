# Managed nodes<a name="managed_instances"></a>

A *managed node* is any machine configured for AWS Systems Manager\. You can configure Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\) instances; AWS IoT Greengrass core devices; and on\-premises servers, edge devices, and virtual machines \(VMs\) in a hybrid environment as managed nodes\.

**Note**  
In the Systems Manager console, any machine prefixed with "mi\-" is an on\-premises server, edge device, or VM configured as a managed node\. Edge devices display their AWS IoT Thing name\.

AWS Systems Manager offers a standard\-instances tier and an advanced\-instances tier\. Both support servers, edge devices, and virtual machines \(VMs\) in your hybrid environment\. The standard\-instances tier allows you to register a maximum of 1,000 machines per AWS account per AWS Region\. If you need to register more than 1,000 machines in a single account and Region, then use the advanced\-instances tier\. You can create as many managed nodes as you like in the advanced\-instances tier\. All managed nodes configured for Systems Manager are priced on a pay\-per\-use basis\. For more information about enabling the advanced instances tier, see [Turning on the advanced\-instances tier](systems-manager-managedinstances-advanced.md)\. For more information about pricing, see [AWS Systems Manager Pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/pricing/)\.

**Note**  
Advanced instances also allow you to connect to your hybrid machines by using AWS Systems Manager Session Manager\. Session Manager provides interactive shell access to your instances\. For more information, see [AWS Systems ManagerÂ Session Manager](session-manager.md)\.
The standard\-instances quota also applies to EC2 instances that use a Systems Manager on\-premises activation \(which isn't a common scenario\)\.
To patch applications released by Microsoft on virtual machines \(VMs\) on\-premises instances, activate the advanced\-instances tier\. There is a charge to use the advanced\-instances tier\. There is no additional charge to patch applications released by Microsoft on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\) instances\. For more information, see [About patching applications released by Microsoft on Windows Server](patch-manager-patching-windows-applications.md)\.

**Display managed nodes**  
If you don't see your managed nodes listed in the console, then do the following:

1. Verify that the console is open in the AWS Region where you created your managed nodes\. You can switch Regions by using the list in the top, right corner of the console\. 

1. Verify that your managed nodes meet Systems Manager requirements\. For information, see [Systems Manager prerequisites](systems-manager-prereqs.md)\.

1. For servers and VMs in a hybrid environment, verify that you completed the activation process\. For more information, see [Setting up Systems Manager for hybrid environments](systems-manager-managedinstances.md)\.

**Note**  
Note the following information\.  
The Fleet Manager console does not display Amazon EC2 nodes that have been terminated\.
Systems Manager requires accurate time references in order to perform operations on your machines\. If the date and time aren't set correctly on your managed nodes, the machines might not match the signature date of your API requests\. For more information, see [Use cases and best practices](systems-manager-best-practices.md)\.
When you create or edit tags, the system can take up to one hour to display changes in the table filter\.

**Verify Systems Manager support on a managed node**  
AWS Config provides AWS Managed Rules, which are predefined, customizable rules that AWS Config uses to evaluate whether your AWS resource configurations comply with common best practices\. AWS Config Managed Rules include the [ec2\-instance\-managed\-by\-systems\-manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/ec2-instance-managed-by-systems-manager.html) rule\. This rule checks whether the Amazon EC2 instances in your account are managed by Systems Manager\. For more information, see [AWS Config Managed Rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/evaluate-config_use-managed-rules.html)\. 

**Increase security posture on managed nodes**  
For information about increasing your security posture against unauthorized root\-level commands on your managed nodes, see [Restricting access to root\-level commands through SSM Agent](ssm-agent-restrict-root-level-commands.md)\.

**Deregister managed nodes**  
You can deregister managed nodes at any time\. For example, if you're managing multiple nodes with the same AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) role and you notice any kind of malicious behavior, you can deregister any number of machines at any point\. For information about deregistering managed nodes, see [Deregistering managed nodes in a hybrid environment](systems-manager-managed-instances-advanced-deregister.md)\.
