# AWS Systems Manager Explorer<a name="Explorer"></a>

AWS Systems Manager Explorer is a customizable operations dashboard that reports information about your AWS resources\. Explorer displays an aggregated view of operations data \(OpsData\) for your AWS accounts and across Regions\. In Explorer, OpsData includes metadata about your Amazon EC2 instances, patch compliance details, and operational work items \(OpsItems\)\. Explorer provides context about how OpsItems are distributed across your business units or applications, how they trend over time, and how they vary by category\. You can group and filter information in Explorer to focus on items that are relevant to you and that require action\. When you identify high priority issues, you can use Systems Manager OpsCenter to run Automation runbooks and quickly resolve those issues\. 

The following image shows some of the individual report boxes, called *widgets*, which are available in Explorer\.

## What Are the Features of Explorer?<a name="Explorer-learn-more-features"></a>

Explorer includes the following features:
+ **Customizable display of actionable information**: Explorer includes drag\-and\-drop widgets that automatically display actionable information about your AWS resources\. Explorer displays information in two types of widgets\.
  + **Informational widgets**: These widgets summarize data from Amazon EC2 and Systems Manager Patch Manager\. These widgets provide important context to help you understand the state and operational risks of your AWS resources\. Examples of informational widgets include **Instance count**, **Managed instances**, **Instance by AMI**, and **Non\-compliant instances for patching**\. 
  + **OpsItem widgets**: A Systems Manager *OpsItem* is an operational work item that is related to one or more AWS resources\. OpsItems are a feature of Systems Manager OpsCenter\. OpsItems may require DevOps engineers to investigate and potentially remediate an issue\. Examples of possible OpsItems include high Amazon EC2 instance CPU utilization, detached Amazon Elastic Block Store volumes, AWS CodeDeploy deployment failure, or Systems Manager Automation execution failure\. Examples of OpsItem widgets include **Open OpsItem summary**, **OpsItem by status**, and **OpsItems over time**\.
+ **Filters**: Each widget offers the ability to filter information based on AWS account, Region, and tag\. Filters help you quickly refine the information displayed in Explorer\.
+ **Direct links to service screens**: To help you investigate issues with AWS resources, Explorer widgets contain direct links to related service screens\. Filters applied to a widget remain in effect if you navigate to a related service screen\.
+ **Groups**: To help you understand the types of operational issues across your organization, some widgets enable you to group data based on account, Region, and tag\.
+ **Reporting tag keys**: When you set up Explorer, you can specify up to five tag keys\. These keys help you group and filter data in Explorer\. If a specified key matches a key on a resource that generates an OpsItem, then the key and value are included in the OpsItems\. 
+ **Three modes of AWS account and Region display**: Explorer includes the following display modes for OpsData and OpsItems in AWS accounts and Regions:

  1. *Single\-account/single\-Region*: This is the default view\. This mode enables users to view data and OpsItems from their own account and the current Region\.

  1. *Single\-account/multiple\-Region*: This mode requires you to create one or more resource data syncs by using the Explorer **Settings** page\. A resource data sync aggregates OpsData from one or more Regions\. After you create a resource data sync, you can toggle which sync to use on the Explorer dashboard\. You can then filter and group data based on Region\.

  1. *Multiple\-account/multiple\-Region*: This mode requires that your organization or company use [AWS Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/) with **All features** enabled\. After you configure AWS Organizations in your computing environment, you can aggregate all account data in a master account\. You can then create resource data syncs so that you can filter and group data based on Region\. For more information about Organizations **All features** mode, see [Enabling All Features in Your Organization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_org_support-all-features.html)\.
+ **Reporting**: You can export Explorer reports as comma separated value \(\.csv\) files to an Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\) bucket\. You receive an alert from Amazon Simple Notification Service \(Amazon SNS\) when an export completes\. 

## How does Explorer relate to OpsCenter?<a name="Explorer-learn-more-OpsCenter"></a>

[Systems Manager OpsCenter](OpsCenter.md) provides a central location where operations engineers and IT professionals view, investigate, and resolve OpsItems related to AWS resources\. Explorer is a report hub where DevOps managers view aggregated summaries of their operations data, including OpsItems, across AWS Regions and accounts\. Explorer helps users discover trends and patterns and, if necessary, quickly resolve issues using Systems Manager Automation runbooks\.

OpsCenter setup is now integrated with Explorer Setup\. If you already set up OpsCenter, then Explorer automatically displays operations data, including aggregated information about OpsItems\. If you have not set up OpsCenter, then you can use Explorer Setup to get started with both capabilities\. For more information, see [Getting Started with Systems Manager Explorer and OpsCenter](Explorer-setup.md)\.

## What is OpsData?<a name="Explorer-learn-more-OpsData"></a>

OpsData is any operations data displayed in the Systems Manager Explorer dashboard\. Explorer retrieves OpsData from Amazon EC2, Systems Manager OpsCenter, and Systems Manager Patch Manager\. You can view and manage OpsData sources from the Explorer **Settings** page\.

## Is There a Charge to Use Explorer?<a name="Explorer-learn-more-cost"></a>

Yes\. When you enable the default rules for creating OpsItems during Integrated Setup, you initiate a process that automatically creates OpsItems\. Your account is charged based on the number of OpsItems created per month\. Your account is also charged based on the number of `GetOpsItem`, `DescribeOpsItem`, `UpdateOpsItem`, and `GetOpsSummary` API calls made per month\. Additionally, you can be charged for public API calls to other services that expose relevant diagnostic information\. For more information, see [AWS Systems Manager Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/pricing/)\.

## Is Explorer Available in All AWS Regions?<a name="Explorer-learn-more-regions"></a>

No\. Explorer is not available in the BAH \(me\-south\-1\) and HKG \(ap\-east\-1\) Regions\.
