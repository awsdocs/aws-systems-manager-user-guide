# Walkthrough: Run the EC2Rescue Tool on Unreachable Instances<a name="automation-ec2rescue"></a>

EC2Rescue can help you diagnose and troubleshoot problems on Amazon EC2 Linux and Windows Server instances\. You can run the tool manually, as described in [Using EC2Rescue for Linux Server](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Linux-Server-EC2Rescue.html) and [Using EC2Rescue for Windows Server](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/Windows-Server-EC2Rescue.html)\. Or, you can run the tool automatically by using Systems Manager Automation and the **AWSSupport\-ExecuteEC2Rescue** document\. The **AWSSupport\-ExecuteEC2Rescue** document is designed to perform a combination of Systems Manager actions, AWS CloudFormation actions, and Lambda functions that automate the steps normally required to use EC2Rescue\. 

You can use the **AWSSupport\-ExecuteEC2Rescue** document to troubleshoot and potentially remediate different types of operating system \(OS\) issues\. See the following topics for a complete list:

**Windows**: See *Rescue Action* in [Using EC2Rescue for Windows Server with the Command Line](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/ec2rw-cli.html#ec2rw-rescue)\.

**Linux**: Some EC2Rescue for Linux modules detect and attempt to remediate issues\. For more information, see the [aws\-ec2rescue\-linux](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-ec2rescue-linux/tree/master/docs) documentation for each module on GitHub\. 

## How It Works<a name="automation-ec2rescue-how"></a>

Troubleshooting an instance with Automation and the **AWSSupport\-ExecuteEC2Rescue** document works as follows:
+ You specify the ID of the unreachable instance and run the Automation workflow\.
+ The system creates a temporary VPC, and then runs a series of Lambda functions to configure the VPC\.
+ The system identifies a subnet for your temporary VPC in the same Availability Zone as your original instance\.
+ The system launches a temporary, SSM\-enabled helper instance\.
+ The system stops your original instance, and creates a backup\. It then attaches the original root volume to the helper instance\.
+ The system uses Run Command to run EC2Rescue on the helper instance\. EC2Rescue identifies and attempts to fix issues on the attached, original root volume\. When finished, EC2Rescue reattaches the root volume back to the original instance\.
+ The system restarts your original instance, and terminates the temporary instance\. The system also terminates the temporary VPC and the Lambda functions created at the start of the automation\.

## Before You Begin<a name="automation-ec2rescue-begin"></a>

Before you run the following Automation, do the following:
+ Copy the instance ID of the unreachable instance\. You will specify this ID in the procedure\.
+ Optionally, collect the ID of a subnet in the same availability zone as your unreachable instance\. The EC2Rescue instance will be created in this subnet\. If you donâ€™t specify a subnet, then Automation creates a new temporary VPC in your AWS account\. Verify that your AWS account has at least one VPC available\. By default, you can create five VPCs in a Region\. If you already created five VPCs in the Region, the automation fails without making changes to your instance\. For more information, see [VPC and Subnets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/adminguide/VPC_Appendix_Limits.html#vpc-limits-vpcs-subnets)\. 
+ Optionally, you can create and specify an AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) role for Automation\. If you don't specify this role, then Automation runs in the context of the user who ran the automation\. For more information about creating roles for Automation, see [Running an Automation Workflow by Using an IAM Service Role](automation-walk-security-assume.md)\.

### Granting AWSSupport\-EC2Rescue Permissions to Perform Actions On Your Instances<a name="automation-ec2rescue-access"></a>

EC2Rescue needs permission to perform a series of actions on your instances during the Automation execution\. These actions invoke the AWS Lambda, IAM, and Amazon EC2 services to safely and securely attempt to remediate issues with your instances\. If you have Administrator\-level permissions in your AWS account and/or VPC, you might be able to run the automation without configuring permissions, as described in this section\. If you don't have Administrator\-level permissions, then you or an administrator must configure permissions by using one of the following options\.

+ [Granting Permissions By Using An AWS CloudFormation Template](#automation-ec2rescue-access-cfn)

#### Granting Permissions By Using IAM Policies<a name="automation-ec2rescue-access-iam"></a>

You can either attach the following IAM policy to your IAM user account, group, or role as an inline policy; or, you can create a new IAM managed policy and attach it to your user account, group, or role\. For more information about adding an inline policy to your user account, group, or role see [Working With Inline Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_inline-using.html)\. For more information about creating a new managed policy, see [Working With Managed Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-using.html)\.

**Note**  
If you create a new IAM managed policy, you must also attach the **AmazonSSMAutomationRole** managed policy to it so that your instances can communicate with the Systems Manager API\.

#### Granting Permissions By Using An AWS CloudFormation Template<a name="automation-ec2rescue-access-cfn"></a>

AWS CloudFormation automates the process of creating IAM roles and policies by using a preconfigured template\. Use the following procedure to create the required IAM roles and policies for the EC2Rescue Automation by using AWS CloudFormation\.

**To create the required IAM roles and policies for EC2Rescue**

1. Download [samples/AWSSupport-EC2RescueRole.zip](samples/AWSSupport-EC2RescueRole.zip) and extract the `AWSSupport-EC2RescueRole.json` file to a directory on your local machine\.

1. If your AWS account is an a special partition, edit the template to change the service endpoint and ARN values to those for your partition\.

   For example, for the China Regions, change `ssm.amazonaws.com` to `ssm.amazonaws.com.cn`, and change all cases of `arn:aws` to `arn:aws-cn`\.

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS CloudFormation console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/cloudformation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/)\.

1. Choose **Create stack**, **With new resources \(standard\)**\.

1. On the **Create stack** page, for **Prerequisite \- Prepare template**, choose **Template is ready**\.

1. For **Specify template**, choose **Upload a template file**\.

1. Choose **Choose file**, and then browse to and select the `AWSSupport-EC2RescueRole.json` file from the directory where you extracted it\.

1. Choose **Next**\.

1. On the **Specify stack details** page, for **Stack name** field, enter a name to identify this stack, and then choose **Next**\.

1. \(Optional\) In the **Tags** area, apply one or more tag key name/value pairs to the stack\.

   Tags are optional metadata that you assign to a resource\. Tags enable you to categorize a resource in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, or environment\. For example, you might want to tag a stack to identify the type of tasks it runs, the types of targets or other resources involved, and the environment it runs in\.

1. Choose **Next**

1. On the **Review** page, review the stack details, and then scroll down and choose the **I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources** option\.

1. Choose **Create stack**\.

   AWS CloudFormation shows the **CREATE\_IN\_PROGRESS** status for a few minutes\. The status changes to **CREATE\_COMPLETE** after the stack has been created\. You can also choose the refresh icon to check the status of the create process\.

1. In the **Stacks** list, choose the option button the stack you just created, and then choose the **Outputs** tab\.

1. Note the **Value**\. The is the ARN of the AssumeRole\. You specify this ARN when you run the Automation in the next procedure, [Running the Automation](#automation-ec2rescue-executing)\.\. 

## Running the Automation<a name="automation-ec2rescue-executing"></a>

**Important**  
The following Automation workflow stops the unreachable instance\. Stopping the instance can result in lost data on attached instance store volumes \(if present\)\. Stopping the instance can also cause the public IP to change, if no Elastic IP is associated\.

**To run the AWSSupport\-ExecuteEC2Rescue Automation**

1. Open the AWS Systems Manager console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/systems\-manager/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Automation**\.

   \-or\-

   If the AWS Systems Manager home page opens first, choose the menu icon \(![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/images/menu-icon-small.png)\) to open the navigation pane, and then choose **Automation**\.

1. Choose **Execute automation**\.

1. In the **Automation document** section, choose **Owned by Amazon** from the list\.

1. In the documents list, choose the button in the card for **AWSSupport\-ExecuteEC2Rescue**, and then choose **Next**\.

1. In the **Execute automation document** page, choose **Simple execution**\.

1. In the **Document details** section, verify that **Document version** is set to the highest default version\. For example, **$DEFAULT** or **3 \(default\)**\.

1. In the **Input parameters** section, specify the following parameters: 

   1. For **UnreachableInstanceId**, specify the ID of the unreachable instance\. 

   1. \(Optional\) For **EC2RescueInstanceType**, specify an instance type for the EC2Rescue instance\. The default instance type is `t2.small`\.

   1. For **AutomationAssumeRole**, if you created roles for this Automation by using the AWS CloudFormation procedure described earlier in this topic, then choose the ARN of the AssumeRole that you created in the AWS CloudFormation console\.

   1. \(Optional\) For **LogDestination**, specify an Amazon S3 bucket if you want to collect operating system\-level logs while troubleshooting your instance\. Logs are automatically uploaded to the specified bucket\.

   1. For **SubnetId**, specify a subnet in an existing VPC in the same availability zone as the unreachable instance\. By default, Systems Manager creates a new VPC, but you can specify a subnet in an existing VPC if you want\.
**Note**  
If you don't see the option to specify a bucket or a subnet ID, verify that you are using the latest **Default** version of the document\.

1. \(Optional\) In the **Tags** area, apply one or more tag key name/value pairs to help identify the execution, for example `Key=Purpose,Value=EC2Rescue`\.

1. Choose **Execute**\.

The Automation creates a backup AMI as part of the workflow\. All other resources created by the Automation workflow are automatically deleted, but this AMI remains in your account\. The AMI is named using the following convention:

Backup AMI: AWSSupport\-EC2Rescue:*UnreachableInstanceId*

You can locate this AMI in the Amazon EC2 console by searching on the Automation execution ID\.
