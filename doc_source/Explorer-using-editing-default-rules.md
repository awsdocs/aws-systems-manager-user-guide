# Editing Default Rules for OpsItems<a name="Explorer-using-editing-default-rules"></a>

When you complete Integrated Setup, the system enables more than a dozen rules in Amazon CloudWatch Events\. These rules automatically create OpsItems in Systems Manager OpsCenter\. Systems Manager Explorer then displays aggregated information about the OpsItems\.

Each rule includes a preset **Category** and **Severity** value\. When the system creates OpsItems from an event, it automatically assigns the preset **Category** and **Severity**\.

**Important**  
Currently, you can't edit the **Category** and **Severity** values for default rules but you can edit these values on OpsItems created from the default rules\.
