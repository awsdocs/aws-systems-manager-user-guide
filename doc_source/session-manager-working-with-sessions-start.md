## Starting a session \(Systems Manager console\)<a name="start-sys-console"></a>

You can use the AWS Systems Manager console to start a session with a managed node in your account\.

**Note**  
Before you start a session, make sure that you have completed the setup steps for Session Manager\. For information, see [Setting up Session Manager](session-manager-getting-started.md)\.

**To start a session \(Systems Manager console\)**

1. Open the AWS Systems Manager console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/systems\-manager/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Session Manager**\.

   \-or\-

   If the AWS Systems Manager home page opens first, choose the menu icon \(![\[The menu icon\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/images/menu-icon-small.png)\) to open the navigation pane, and then choose **Session Manager** in the navigation pane\.

1. Choose **Start session**\.

1. \(Optional\) Enter a reason for the session in the **Reason for session** field\.

1. For **Target instances**, choose the option button to the left of the managed node you want to connect to\.

   If a managed node you want to connect to isn't in the list, or is listed but an error message reports, "The instance you selected isn't configured to use Session Manager," see [Managed node not available or not configured for Session Manager](session-manager-troubleshooting.md#session-manager-troubleshooting-instances) for troubleshooting steps\.

1. Choose **Start session**\.

After the connection is made, you can run bash commands \(Linux and macOS\) or PowerShell commands \(Windows\) as you would through any other connection type\.

## Starting a session \(Amazon EC2 console\)<a name="start-ec2-console"></a>

You can use the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\) console to start a session with an instance in your account\.

**Note**  
If you receive an error that you aren't authorized to perform one or more Systems Manager actions \(`ssm:command-name`, then you must contact your administrator for assistance\. Your administrator is the person that provided you with your sign\-in credentials\. Ask that person to update your policies to allow you to start sessions from the Amazon EC2 console\. If you're an administrator, see [Quickstart default IAM policies for Session Manager](getting-started-restrict-access-quickstart.md) for more information\.

**To start a session \(Amazon EC2 console\)**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Instances**\.

1. Select the instance and choose **Connect**\.

1. For **Connection method**, choose **Session Manager**\.

1. Choose **Connect**\.

After the connection is made, you can run bash commands \(Linux and macOS\) or PowerShell commands \(Windows\) as you would through any other connection type\.

## Starting a session \(AWS CLI\)<a name="sessions-start-cli"></a>

Install and configure the AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\), if you haven't already\.

For information, see [Installing or updating the latest version of the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)\.

Before you start a session, make sure that you have completed the setup steps for Session Manager\. For information, see [Setting up Session Manager](session-manager-getting-started.md)\.

To use the AWS CLI to run session commands, the Session Manager plugin must also be installed on your local machine\. For information, see [Install the Session Manager plugin for the AWS CLI](session-manager-working-with-install-plugin.md)\.

To start a session using the AWS CLI, run the following command replacing *instance\-id* with your own information\.

```
aws ssm start-session \
    --target instance-id
```

For information about other options you can use with the start\-session command, see [start\-session](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ssm/start-session.html) in the AWS Systems Manager section of the AWS CLI Command Reference\.

## Starting a session \(SSH\)<a name="sessions-start-ssh"></a>

To start a Session Manager SSH session, version 2\.3\.672\.0 or later of SSM Agent must be installed on the managed node\.

**SSH connection requirements**  
Take note of the following requirements and limitations for session connections using SSH:
+ Your target managed node must be configured to support SSH connections\. For more information, see [\(Optional\) Enable and control permissions for SSH connections through Session Manager](session-manager-getting-started-enable-ssh-connections.md)\.
+ You must connect using the managed node account associated with the Privacy Enhanced Mail \(PEM\) certificate, not the `ssm-user` account that is used for other types of session connections\. For example, on EC2 instances for Linux and macOS, the default user is `ec2-user`\. For information about identifying the default user for each instance type, see [Get Information About Your Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/connection-prereqs.html#connection-prereqs-get-info-about-instance) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\.
+ Logging isn't available for Session Manager sessions that connect through port forwarding or SSH\. This is because SSH encrypts all session data, and Session Manager only serves as a tunnel for SSH connections\.

**Note**  
Before you start a session, make sure that you have completed the setup steps for Session Manager\. For information, see [Setting up Session Manager](session-manager-getting-started.md)\.

To start a session using SSH, run the following command\. Replace each *example resource placeholder* with your own information\.

```
ssh -i /path/my-key-pair.pem username@instance-id
```

**Tip**  
When you start a session using SSH, you can copy local files to the target managed node using the following command format\.  

```
scp -i /path/my-key-pair.pem /path/ExampleFile.txt username@instance-id:~
```

For information about other options you can use with the start\-session command, see [start\-session](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ssm/start-session.html) in the AWS Systems Manager section of the AWS CLI Command Reference\.

## Starting a session \(port forwarding\)<a name="sessions-start-port-forwarding"></a>

To start a Session Manager port forwarding session, version 2\.3\.672\.0 or later of SSM Agent must be installed on the managed node\.

**Note**  
Before you start a session, make sure that you have completed the setup steps for Session Manager\. For information, see [Setting up Session Manager](session-manager-getting-started.md)\.  
To use the AWS CLI to run session commands, you must install the Session Manager plugin on your local machine\. For information, see [Install the Session Manager plugin for the AWS CLI](session-manager-working-with-install-plugin.md)\.  
Depending on your operating system and command line tool, the placement of quotation marks can differ and escape characters might be required\.

To start a port forwarding session, run the following command from the CLI\. Replace each *example resource placeholder* with your own information\.

------
#### [ Linux & macOS ]

```
aws ssm start-session \
    --target instance-id \
    --document-name AWS-StartPortForwardingSession \
    --parameters '{"portNumber":["80"], "localPortNumber":["56789"]}'
```

------
#### [ Windows ]

```
aws ssm start-session ^
    --target instance-id ^
    --document-name AWS-StartPortForwardingSession ^
    --parameters portNumber="3389",localPortNumber="56789"
```

------

The value you specify for `portNumber` represents the remote port on the managed node where traffic should be redirected to, such as `3389` for connecting to a Windows node using the Remote Desktop Protocol \(RDP\)\. If this parameter isn't specified, Session Manager assumes `80` as the default remote port\. 

The value you specify for `localPortNumber` represents the local port on the client where traffic should be redirected to, such as `56789`\. This value is what you enter when connecting to a managed node using a client\. For example, **localhost:56789**\.

For information about other options you can use with the start\-session command, see [start\-session](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ssm/start-session.html) in the AWS Systems Manager section of the AWS CLI Command Reference\.

For more information about port forwarding sessions, see [Port Forwarding Using AWS Systems ManagerSession Manager](http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-port-forwarding-using-aws-system-manager-sessions-manager/) in the *AWS News Blog*\.

## Starting a session \(port forwarding to remote host\)<a name="sessions-remote-port-forwarding"></a>

To start a Session Manager port forwarding session to a remote host, version 3\.1\.1374\.0 or later of SSM Agent must be installed on the managed node\. The remote host isn't required to be managed by Systems Manager\.

**Note**  
Before you start a session, make sure that you have completed the setup steps for Session Manager\. For information, see [Setting up Session Manager](session-manager-getting-started.md)\.  
To use the AWS CLI to run session commands, you must install the Session Manager plugin on your local machine\. For information, see [Install the Session Manager plugin for the AWS CLI](session-manager-working-with-install-plugin.md)\.  
Depending on your operating system and command line tool, the placement of quotation marks can differ and escape characters might be required\.

To start a port forwarding session, run the following command from the CLI\. Replace each *example resource placeholder* with your own information\.

------
#### [ Linux & macOS ]

```
aws ssm start-session \
    --target instance-id \
    --document-name AWS-StartPortForwardingSessionToRemoteHost \
    --parameters '{"host":["mydb.example.us-east-2.rds.amazonaws.com"],"portNumber":["3306"], "localPortNumber":["3306"]}'
```

------
#### [ Windows ]

```
aws ssm start-session ^
    --target instance-id ^
    --document-name AWS-StartPortForwardingSessionToRemoteHost ^
    --parameters host="mydb.example.us-east-2.rds.amazonaws.com",portNumber="3306",localPortNumber="3306"
```

------

The value you specify for `host` represents the hostname or IP address of the remote host you want to connect to\. General connectivity and name resolution requirements between the managed node and the remote host still apply\.

The value you specify for `portNumber` represents the remote port on the managed node where traffic should be redirected to, such as `3306` for connecting to a MySQL database\. If this parameter isn't specified, Session Manager assumes `80` as the default remote port\. 

The value you specify for `localPortNumber` represents the local port on the client where traffic should be redirected to, such as `56789`\. This value is what you enter when connecting to a managed node using a client\. For example, **localhost:56789**\.

For information about other options you can use with the start\-session command, see [start\-session](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ssm/start-session.html) in the AWS Systems Manager section of the AWS CLI Command Reference\.

## Starting a session \(interactive and noninteractive commands\)<a name="sessions-start-interactive-commands"></a>

Before you start a session, make sure that you have completed the setup steps for Session Manager\. For information, see [Setting up Session Manager](session-manager-getting-started.md)\.

To use the AWS CLI to run session commands, the Session Manager plugin must also be installed on your local machine\. For information, see [Install the Session Manager plugin for the AWS CLI](session-manager-working-with-install-plugin.md)\.

To start an interactive command session, run the following command\. Replace each *example resource placeholder* with your own information\.

------
#### [ Linux & macOS ]

```
aws ssm start-session \
    --target instance-id \
    --document-name CustomCommandSessionDocument \
    --parameters '{"logpath":["/var/log/amazon/ssm/amazon-ssm-agent.log"]}'
```

------
#### [ Windows ]

```
aws ssm start-session ^
    --target instance-id ^
    --document-name CustomCommandSessionDocument ^
    --parameters logpath="/var/log/amazon/ssm/amazon-ssm-agent.log"
```

------

For information about other options you can use with the start\-session command, see [start\-session](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ssm/start-session.html) in the AWS Systems Manager section of the AWS CLI Command Reference\.
