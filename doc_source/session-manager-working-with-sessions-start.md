## Starting a Session \(Systems Manager Console\)<a name="start-sys-console"></a>

You can use the AWS Systems Manager console to start a session with an instance in your account\.

**Note**  
Before attempting to start a session, ensure that the necessary setup steps for Session Manager have been completed\. For information, see [Getting Started with Session Manager](session-manager-getting-started.md)\.

**To start a session \( Systems Manager console\)**

1. Open the AWS Systems Manager console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/systems\-manager/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Session Manager**\.

   \-or\-

   If the AWS Systems Manager home page opens first, choose the menu icon \(![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/images/menu-icon-small.png)\) to open the navigation pane, and then choose **Session Manager** in the navigation pane\.

1. Choose **Start session**\.

1. For **Target instances**, choose the option button to the left of the instance you want to connect to\.

   If an instance you want to connect to is not in the list, or is listed but an error message reports, "The instance you selected is not configured to use Session Manager," see [Instance Not Available or Not Configured for Session Manager](session-manager-troubleshooting.md#session-manager-troubleshooting-instances) for troubleshooting steps\.

1. Choose **Start session**\.

After the connection is made, you can run bash commands \(Linux\) or PowerShell commands \(Windows\) as you would through any other connection type\.

## Starting a Session \(Amazon EC2 Console\)<a name="start-ec2-console"></a>

You can use the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\) console to start a session with an instance in your account\.

**Note**  
If you receive an error that youâ€™re not authorized to perform one or more Systems Manager actions \(`ssm:command-name`, then you must contact your administrator for assistance\. Your administrator is the person that provided you with your user name and password\. Ask that person to update your policies to allow you to start sessions from the Amazon EC2 console\. If you are an administrator, see [Quickstart Default IAM Policies for Session Manager](getting-started-restrict-access-quickstart.md) for more information\.

**To start a session \(Amazon EC2 console\)**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Instances**

1. Select the instance and choose **Connect**\.

1. For **Connection method**, choose **Session Manager**\.

1. Choose **Connect**\.

After the connection is made, you can run bash commands \(Linux\) or PowerShell commands \(Windows\) as you would through any other connection type\.

## Starting a Session \(AWS CLI\)<a name="sessions-start-cli"></a>

To start a session using the AWS CLI, run the following command:

**Note**  
Before attempting to start a session, ensure that the necessary setup steps for Session Manager have been completed\. For information, see [Getting Started with Session Manager](session-manager-getting-started.md)\.  
To use the AWS CLI to run session commands, the Session Manager plugin must also be installed on your local machine\. For information, see [\(Optional\) Install the Session Manager Plugin for the AWS CLI](session-manager-working-with-install-plugin.md)\.

```
aws ssm start-session --target instance-id
```

 *instance\-id* represents of the ID of an instance configured for use with AWS Systems Manager and its Session Manager capability, such as `i-02573cafcfEXAMPLE`\.

For information about other options you can use with the start\-session command, see [start\-session](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ssm/start-session.html) in the AWS Systems Manager section of the AWS CLI Command Reference\.

## Starting a Session \(SSH\)<a name="sessions-start-ssh"></a>

**SSH Connection Requirements**  
Take note of the following requirements for starting a session using SSH\.
+ Your target instance must be configured to support SSH connections\. For more information, see [\(Optional\) Enable SSH Connections Through Session Manager](session-manager-getting-started-enable-ssh-connections.md)\.
+ You must use the user on the instance associated with the Privacy Enhanced Mail \(PEM\) certificate, not the `ssm-user` account that is used for other types of session connections\. For example, on Amazon EC2 instances for Linux, the default user is `ec2-user`\. For information about identifying the default user for each instance type, see [Get Information About Your Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/connection-prereqs.html#connection-prereqs-get-info-about-instance) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\.

**Note**  
Before attempting to start a session, ensure that the necessary setup steps for Session Manager have been completed\. For information, see [Getting Started with Session Manager](session-manager-getting-started.md)\.

To start a session using SSH, run the following command:

```
ssh -i /path/my-key-pair.pem username@instance-id
```

 */path/my\-key\-pair\.pem* represents the path to the PEM certificate that is associated with the instance\. For example, for an Amazon EC2 instance, the key\-pair file you created or selected when you created the instance\.

 *username@instance\-id* represents the default user name for your instance type, and the instance ID, such as `ec2-user@i-02573cafcfEXAMPLE`\.

**Tip**  
When you start a session using SSH, you can copy local files to the target instance using the following command format\.  

```
scp -i /path/my-key-pair.pem /path/SampleFile.txt username@instance-id:~
```

For information about other options you can use with the start\-session command, see [start\-session](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ssm/start-session.html) in the AWS Systems Manager section of the AWS CLI Command Reference\.

## Starting a Session \(Port Forwarding\)<a name="sessions-start-port-forwarding"></a>

To start a port forwarding session, run the following command from the CLI:

**Note**  
Before attempting to start a session, ensure that the necessary setup steps for Session Manager have been completed\. For information, see [Getting Started with Session Manager](session-manager-getting-started.md)\.  
To use the AWS CLI to run session commands, the Session Manager plugin must also be installed on your local machine\. For information, see [\(Optional\) Install the Session Manager Plugin for the AWS CLI](session-manager-working-with-install-plugin.md)\.

------
#### [ Linux ]

```
aws ssm start-session \
--target instance-id \
--document-name AWS-StartPortForwardingSession \ 
--parameters '{"portNumber":["80"], "localPortNumber":["56789"]}'
```

------
#### [ Windows ]

```
aws ssm start-session ^
--target instance-id ^
--document-name AWS-StartPortForwardingSession ^
--parameters portNumber="3389",localPortNumber="56789"
```

------

 *instance\-id* represents of the ID of an instance configured for use with AWS Systems Manager and its Session Manager capability, such as `i-02573cafcfEXAMPLE`\.

*portNumber* represents the remote port on the instance where traffic should be redirected to, such as `3389`\. If this parameter is not specified, Session Manager assumes `80` as the default remote port\. 

*localPortNumber* represents the local port on the client where traffic should be redirected to, such as `56789`\. 

For information about other options you can use with the start\-session command, see [start\-session](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ssm/start-session.html) in the AWS Systems Manager section of the AWS CLI Command Reference\.

## Starting a Session \(Interactive Commands\)<a name="sessions-start-interactive-commands"></a>

To start an Interactive Command session, run the following command:

**Note**  
Before attempting to start a session, ensure that the necessary setup steps for Session Manager have been completed\. For information, see [Getting Started with Session Manager](session-manager-getting-started.md)\.
