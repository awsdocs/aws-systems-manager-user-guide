# Walkthrough: Creating associations that run Chef recipes<a name="systems-manager-state-manager-chef"></a>

You can create State Manager associations that run Chef recipes by using the `AWS-ApplyChefRecipes` SSM document\. State Manager is a capability of AWS Systems Manager\. You can target Linux\-based Systems Manager managed nodes with the `AWS-ApplyChefRecipes` SSM document\. This document offers the following benefits for running Chef recipes:
+ Supports multiple releases of Chef \(Chef 11 through Chef 15\)\.
+ Automatically installs the Chef client software on target nodes\.
+ Optionally runs [Systems Manager compliance checks](systems-manager-compliance.md) on target nodes, and stores the results of compliance checks in an Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\) bucket\.
+ Runs multiple cookbooks and recipes in a single run of the document\.
+ Optionally runs recipes in `why-run` mode, to show which recipes change on target nodes without making changes\.
+ Optionally applies custom JSON attributes to `chef-client` runs\.

You can use GitHub or Amazon S3 buckets as sources for Chef cookbooks and recipes that you specify in an `AWS-ApplyChefRecipes` document\.

**Note**  
Associations that run Chef recipes aren't supported on macOS\.

## Prerequisites: Set up your association, repository, and cookbooks<a name="state-manager-chef-prereqs"></a>

Before you create an `AWS-ApplyChefRecipes` document, prepare your Chef cookbooks and cookbook repository\. If you don't already have a Chef cookbook that you want to use, you can get started by using a test `HelloWorld` cookbook that AWS has prepared for you\. The `AWS-ApplyChefRecipes` document already points to this cookbook by default\. Your cookbooks should be set up similarly to the following directory structure\. In the following example, `jenkins` and `nginx` are examples of Chef cookbooks that are available in the [Chef Supermarket](https://supermarket.chef.io/) on the Chef website\.

Though AWS can't officially support cookbooks on the [Chef Supermarket](https://supermarket.chef.io/) website, many of them work with the `AWS-ApplyChefRecipes` document\. The following are examples of criteria to determine when you're testing a community cookbook:
+ The cookbook should support the Linux\-based operating systems of the Systems Manager managed nodes that you're targeting\.
+ The cookbook should be valid for the Chef client version \(Chef 11 through Chef 15\) that you use\.
+ The cookbook is compatible with Chef Infra Client, and, doesn't require a Chef server\.

Verify that you can reach the Chef\.io website, so that any cookbooks you specify in your run list can be installed when the Systems Manager document \(SSM document\) runs\. Using a nested `cookbooks` folder is supported, but not required; you can store cookbooks directly under the root level\.

```
<Top-level directory, or the top level of the archive file (ZIP or tgz or tar.gz)>
    └── cookbooks (optional level)
        ├── jenkins
        │   ├── metadata.rb
        │   └── recipes
        └── nginx
            ├── metadata.rb
            └── recipes
```

**Important**  
Before you create a State Manager association that runs Chef recipes, be aware that the document run installs the Chef client software on your Systems Manager managed nodes, unless you set the value of **Chef client version** to `None`\. This operation uses an installation script from Chef to install Chef components on your behalf\. Before you run an `AWS-ApplyChefRecipes` document, be sure your enterprise can comply with any applicable legal requirements, including license terms applicable to the use of Chef software\. For more information, see the [Chef website](https://www.chef.io/)\.

Systems Manager can deliver compliance reports to an S3 bucket, the Systems Manager console, or make compliance results available in response to Systems Manager API commands\. To run Systems Manager compliance reports, the instance profile attached to Systems Manager managed nodes must have permissions to write to the S3 bucket\. The instance profile must have permissions to use the Systems Manager `PutComplianceItem` API\. For more information about Systems Manager compliance, see [AWS Systems Manager Compliance](systems-manager-compliance.md)\.

### Logging the document run<a name="state-manager-chef-logging"></a>

When you run a Systems Manager document \(SSM document\) by using a State Manager association, you can configure the association to choose the output of the document run, and you can send the output to Amazon S3 or Amazon CloudWatch Logs \(CloudWatch Logs\)\. To help ease troubleshooting when an association has finished running, verify that the association is configured to write command output to either an Amazon S3 bucket or CloudWatch Logs\. For more information, see [Creating associations](sysman-state-assoc.md)\.

## Use GitHub as a cookbook source<a name="state-manager-chef-github"></a>

The `AWS-ApplyChefRecipes` document uses the [`aws:downloadContent`](documents-command-ssm-plugin-reference.md#aws-downloadContent) plugin to download cookbooks\. To download content from GitHub, specify information about your GitHub repository to the document in JSON format\. The following is an example\.

```
{
   "owner":"TestUser",
   "repository":"GitHubCookbookRepository",
   "path":"cookbooks/HelloWorld",
   "getOptions":"branch:master",
   "tokenInfo":"{{ssm-secure:secure-string-token}}"
}
```

## Use Amazon S3 as a cookbook source<a name="state-manager-chef-s3"></a>

You can also store and download Chef cookbooks in Amazon S3 as either a single `.zip` or `tar.gz` file or a directory structure\. To download content from Amazon S3, specify the path to the file\. Here are two examples\.

**Example 1: Download a specific cookbook**

```
{
   "path":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/chef-cookbooks/HelloWorld.zip"
}
```

**Example 2: Download the contents of a directory**

```
{
   "path":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/chef-cookbooks-test/HelloWorld"
}
```

**Important**  
If you specify Amazon S3, the AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) instance profile on your managed nodes must be configured with the `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess` policy\. For more information, see [Configure instance permissions for Systems Manager](setup-instance-permissions.md)\.

## Create an association that runs Chef recipes \(console\)<a name="state-manager-chef-console"></a>

The following procedure describes how to use the Systems Manager console to create a State Manager association that runs Chef cookbooks by using the `AWS-ApplyChefRecipes` document\.

1. Open the AWS Systems Manager console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/systems\-manager/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **State Manager**\.

   \-or\-

   If the AWS Systems Manager home page opens first, choose the menu icon \(![\[The menu icon\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/images/menu-icon-small.png)\) to open the navigation pane, and then choose ** State Manager**\.

1. Choose **State Manager**, and then choose **Create association**\.

1. For **Name**, enter a name that helps you remember the purpose of the association\.

1. In the **Document** list, choose **`AWS-ApplyChefRecipes`**\.

1. In **Parameters**, for **Source Type**, choose either **GitHub** or **S3**\.

1. In **Source info**, enter cookbook source information in one of the following formats\.

   1. If you chose **GitHub** in step 5, enter repository information in the following format\.

      ```
      {
         "owner":"user_name",
         "repository":"name",
         "path":"path_to_directory_or_cookbook_to_download",
         "getOptions":"branch:branch_name",
         "tokenInfo":"{{(Optional)_token_information}}"
      }
      ```

   1. If you chose **S3** in step 5, enter path information in the following format\.

      ```
      {
         "path":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/path_to_directory_or_cookbook_to_download"
      }
      ```

1. In **Run list**, list the recipes that you want to run in the following format, separating each recipe with a comma as shown\. Don't include a space after the comma\.

   ```
   recipe[cookbook_name1::recipe_name],recipe[cookbook_name2::recipe_name]
   ```

1. \(Optional\) In **JSON attributes content**, add any custom JSON that contains attributes you want the Chef client to pass to your target nodes\.

   The **JSON attributes content** parameter is best used for the following purposes:
   + When you want to override a small number of attributes and you don't otherwise need to use custom cookbooks\.

     Custom JSON can help you avoid the extra work of setting up and maintaining a cookbook repository to override only a few attributes\.
   + Values that are expected to vary\.

     For example, if your Chef cookbooks configure a third\-party application that accepts payments, you can use custom JSON to specify the payment endpoint URL\. If the third\-party software manufacturer changes the payment endpoint URL, you can use custom JSON to update the payment endpoint to the new URL\.

1. For **Chef client version**, specify a Chef version\. Valid values are `11`, `12`, `13`, `14`, `15`, or `None`\. If you specify `11` through `15`, Systems Manager installs the correct Chef client version on your target nodes\. If you specify `None`, Systems Manager doesn't install the Chef client on target nodes before running the document's recipes\. The default value is `15`\.

1. \(Optional\) For **Chef client arguments**, specify additional arguments that are supported for the version of Chef you're using\. To learn more about supported arguments, run `chef-client -h` on a node that is running the Chef client\.

1. \(Optional\) Turn on **Why\-run** to show changes made to target nodes if the recipes are run, without actually changing target nodes\.

1. For **Compliance severity**, choose the severity of Systems Manager Compliance results that you want reported\. Compliance reporting indicates whether the association state is compliant or noncompliant, along with the severity level you specify\. Compliance reports are stored in an S3 bucket that you specify as the value of the **Compliance report bucket** parameter \(step 14\)\. For more information about Compliance, see [Working with Compliance](sysman-compliance-about.md) in this guide\.

   Compliance scans measure drift between configuration that is specified in your Chef recipes and node resources\. Valid values are `Critical`, `High`, `Medium`, `Low`, `Informational`, `Unspecified`, or `None`\. To skip compliance reporting, choose `None`\.

1. For **Compliance type**, specify the compliance type for which you want results reported\. Valid values are `Association` for State Manager associations, or `Custom:`*custom\_type*\. The default value is `Custom:Chef`\.

1. For **Compliance report bucket**, enter the name of an S3 bucket in which to store information about every Chef run performed by this document, including resource configuration and Compliance results\.

1. In **Rate control**, configure options to run State Manager associations across a fleet of managed nodes\. For information about using rate controls, see [About targets and rate controls in State Manager associations](systems-manager-state-manager-targets-and-rate-controls.md)\.

   In **Concurrency**, choose an option:
   + Choose **targets** to enter an absolute number of targets that can run the association simultaneously\.
   + Choose **percentage** to enter a percentage of the target set that can run the association simultaneously\.

   In **Error threshold**, choose an option:
   + Choose **errors** to enter an absolute number of errors that are allowed before State Manager stops running associations on additional targets\.
   + Choose **percentage** to enter a percentage of errors that are allowed before State Manager stops running associations on additional targets\.

1. \(Optional\) For **Output options**, to save the command output to a file, select the **Enable writing output to S3** box\. Enter the bucket and prefix \(folder\) names in the boxes\.
**Note**  
The S3 permissions that grant the ability to write the data to an S3 bucket are those of the instance profile assigned to the managed node, not those of the IAM user performing this task\. For more information, see [Configure instance permissions for Systems Manager](setup-instance-permissions.md) or [Create an IAM service role for a hybrid environment](sysman-service-role.md)\. In addition, if the specified S3 bucket is in a different AWS account, verify that the instance profile or IAM service role associated with the managed node has the necessary permissions to write to that bucket\.

1. Choose **Create Association**\.

## Create an association that runs Chef recipes \(CLI\)<a name="state-manager-chef-cli"></a>

The following procedure describes how to use the AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\) to create a State Manager association that runs Chef cookbooks by using the `AWS-ApplyChefRecipes` document\.

1. Install and configure the AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\), if you haven't already\.

   For information, see [Installing or updating the latest version of the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)\.

1. Run one of the following commands to create an association that runs Chef cookbooks by targeting nodes using tags\. Replace each *example resource placeholder* with your own information\. Command \(A\) uses GitHub as the source type\. Command \(B\) uses Amazon S3 as the source type\.

   **\(A\) GitHub source**

**Note**  
State Manager associations don't support all cron and rate expressions\. For more information about creating cron and rate expressions for associations, see [Reference: Cron and rate expressions for Systems Manager](reference-cron-and-rate-expressions.md)\.

   The system attempts to create the association on the nodes and immediately apply the state\.

1. Run the following command to view an updated status of the association you just created\. 

   ```
   aws ssm describe-association --association-id "ID"
   ```

## Viewing Chef resource compliance details<a name="state-manager-chef-compliance"></a>

Systems Manager captures compliance information about Chef\-managed resources in the Amazon S3 **Compliance report bucket** value that you specified when you ran the `AWS-ApplyChefRecipes` document\. Searching for information about Chef resource failures in an S3 bucket can be time consuming\. Instead, you can view this information on the Systems Manager **Compliance** page\.

A Systems Manager Compliance scan collects information about resources on your managed nodes that were created or checked in the most recent Chef run\. The resources can include files, directories, `systemd` services, `yum` packages, templated files, `gem` packages, and dependent cookbooks, among others\.

The **Compliance resources summary** section displays a count of resources that failed\. In the following example, the **ComplianceType** is **Custom:Chef** and one resource is noncompliant\.

**Note**  
`Custom:Chef` is the default **ComplianceType** value in the `AWS-ApplyChefRecipes` document\. This value is customizable\.

![\[Viewing counts in the Compliance resources summary section of the Compliance page.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/images/state-manager-chef-compliance-summary.png)

The **Details overview for resources** section shows information about the AWS resource that isn't in compliance\. This section also includes the Chef resource type against which compliance was run, severity of issue, compliance status, and links to more information when applicable\.

![\[Viewing compliance details for a Chef managed resource failure\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/images/state-manager-chef-compliance-details.png)

**View output** shows the last 4,000 characters of the detailed status\. Systems Manager starts with the exception as the first element, finds verbose messages, and shows them until it reaches the 4,000 character quota\. This process displays the log messages that were output before the exception was thrown, which are the most relevant messages for troubleshooting\.

For information about how to view compliance information, see [AWS Systems Manager Compliance](systems-manager-compliance.md)\.

### Association failures affect compliance reporting<a name="state-manager-chef-compliance-reporting"></a>

If the State Manager association fails, no compliance data is reported\. For example, if Systems Manager attempts to download a Chef cookbook from an S3 bucket that the node doesn't have permission to access, the association fails, and Systems Manager reports no compliance data\.
