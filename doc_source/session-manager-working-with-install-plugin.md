# \(Optional\) Install the Session Manager Plugin for the AWS CLI<a name="session-manager-working-with-install-plugin"></a>

If you want to use the AWS CLI to start and end sessions that connect you to your managed instances, you must first install the Session Manager plugin on your local machine\. The plugin can be installed on supported versions of Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux, and Ubuntu Server\.

**Use the Latest Version of the Session Manager Plugin**  
The plugin is updated occasionally with enhanced functionality\. We recommend that you regularly ensure you are using the latest version of the plugin\. For more information, see [ Session Manager Plugin Latest Version and Release History](#plugin-version-history)\.

**Installation Prerequisite**  
AWS CLI version 1\.16\.12 or later must be installed on your local machine in order to use the Session Manager plugin\.

## Install the Session Manager Plugin on Windows<a name="install-plugin-windows"></a>

You can install the Session Manager plugin on Microsoft Windows Vista or later using the standalone installer\.

When updates are released, you must repeat the installation process to get the latest version of the Session Manager plugin\.

**Note**  
For best results, we recommend starting sessions on Windows clients using the Windows PowerShell application version 5 or later\. On Microsoft Windows 10, the Command Prompt also provides reliable support for Session Manager operations\.

**To install the Session Manager plugin using the EXE installer**

1. Download the installer using the following URL:

   ```
   https://s3.amazonaws.com/session-manager-downloads/plugin/latest/windows/SessionManagerPluginSetup.exe
   ```

1. Run the downloaded installer and follow the on\-screen the instructions\.

   Leave the install location box blank to install the plugin to the default directory:
   + `C:\%PROGRAMFILES%\Amazon\SessionManagerPlugin\bin\` 

1. Verify that the installation was successful\. For information, see [Verify the Session Manager Plugin Installation](#install-plugin-verify)\.
**Note**  
If Windows is unable to find the executable, you might need to re\-open the command prompt or add the installation directory to your `PATH` environment variable manually\. For information, see the troubleshooting topic [Session Manager Plugin Not Automatically Added to Command Line Path \(Windows\)](session-manager-troubleshooting.md#windows-plugin-env-var-not-set)\.

## Install and Uninstall the Session Manager Plugin on macOS<a name="install-plugin-macos"></a>

You can install the Session Manager plugin on macOS using the bundled installer\.

**Important**  
The bundled installer does not support installing to paths that contain spaces\.

**To install the Session Manager plugin using the bundled installer \(macOS\)**

1. Download the bundled installer:

   ```
   curl "https://s3.amazonaws.com/session-manager-downloads/plugin/latest/mac/sessionmanager-bundle.zip" -o "sessionmanager-bundle.zip"
   ```

1. Unzip the package:

   ```
   unzip sessionmanager-bundle.zip
   ```

1. Run the install command:

   ```
   sudo ./sessionmanager-bundle/install -i /usr/local/sessionmanagerplugin -b /usr/local/bin/session-manager-plugin
   ```
**Note**  
The plugin requires Python 2\.6\.5 or later or Python 3\.3\. By default, the install script runs under the system default version of Python\. If you have installed an alternative version of Python and want to use that to install the Session Manager plugin, run the install script with that version by absolute path to the Python executable\. The following is an example\.  

   ```
   sudo /usr/local/bin/python3.6 sessionmanager-bundle/install -i /usr/local/sessionmanagerplugin -b /usr/local/bin/session-manager-plugin
   ```

   The installer installs the Session Manager plugin at `/usr/local/sessionmanagerplugin` and creates the symlink `session-manager-plugin` in the `/usr/local/bin` directory\. This eliminates the need to specify the install directory in the user's `$PATH` variable\.

   To see an explanation of the \-i and \-b options, use the \-h option:

   ```
   ./sessionmanager-bundle/install -h
   ```

1. Verify that the installation was successful\. For information, see [Verify the Session Manager Plugin Installation](#install-plugin-verify)\.

**Note**  
If you ever want to uninstall the plugin, run the following two commands, one at a time:  

```
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/sessionmanagerplugin
```

```
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/session-manager-plugin
```

## Verify the Session Manager Plugin Installation<a name="install-plugin-verify"></a>

Run the following commands to verify that the Session Manager plugin installed successfully:

```
session-manager-plugin
```

If the installation was successful, the following message is returned:

```
The Session Manager plugin is installed successfully. Use the AWS CLI to start a session.
```

You can also test the installation by running the following command in the AWS CLI:

**Note**  
This command will work only if your Session Manager administrator has granted you the necessary IAM permissions to access the target instance using Session Manager\.

```
aws ssm start-session --target id-of-an-instance-you-have-permissions-to-access
```

## \(Optional\) Enable Session Manager Plugin Logging<a name="install-plugin-configure-logs"></a>

The Session Manager plugin includes an option to enable logging for sessions that you run\. By default, logging is disabled\.

If you enable logging, the Session Manager plugin creates log files for both application activity \(`session-manager-plugin.log`\) and errors \(`errors.log`\) on your local machine\.

**Topics**
+ [Enable Logging for the Session Manager Plugin \(Windows\)](#configure-logs-windows)
+ [Enable Logging for the Session Manager Plugin \(Linux and macOS\)](#configure-logs-linux)

### Enable Logging for the Session Manager Plugin \(Windows\)<a name="configure-logs-windows"></a>

1. Locate the `seelog.xml.template` file for the plugin\. 

   The default location is `C:\Program Files\Amazon\SessionManagerPlugin\seelog.xml.template`\.

1. Change the name of the file to `seelog.xml`\.

1. Open the file and change `minlevel="off"` to `minlevel="info"` or `minlevel="debug"`\.
**Note**  
By default, log entries about opening a data channel and reconnecting sessions are recorded at the INFO level\. Data flow \(packets and acknowledgement\) entries are recorded at the DEBUG level\.

1. Change other configuration options you want to modify\. Options you can change include: 
   + **Debug level**: You can change the debug level from `formatid="fmtinfo"` to `outputs formatid="fmtdebug"`\.
   + **Log file options**: You can make changes to the log file options, including where the logs are stored, with the exception of the log file names\. 
**Important**  
Do not change the file names or logging will not work correctly\.

     ```
     <rollingfile type="size" filename="C:\%PROGRAMDATA%\Amazon\SessionManagerPlugin\Logs\session-manager-plugin.log" maxsize="30000000" maxrolls="5"/>
     <filter levels="error,critical" formatid="fmterror">
     <rollingfile type="size" filename="C:\%PROGRAMDATA%\Amazon\SessionManagerPlugin\Logs\errors.log" maxsize="10000000" maxrolls="5"/>
     ```

1. Save the file\.

### Enable Logging for the Session Manager Plugin \(Linux and macOS\)<a name="configure-logs-linux"></a>

1. Locate the `seelog.xml.template` file for the plugin\. 

   The default location is `/usr/local/sessionmanagerplugin/seelog.xml.template`\.

1. Change the name of the file to `seelog.xml`\.

1. Open the file and change `minlevel="off"` to `minlevel="info"` or `minlevel="debug"`\.
**Note**  
By default, log entries about opening data channels and reconnecting sessions are recorded at the INFO level\. Data flow \(packets and acknowledgement\) entries are recorded at the DEBUG level\.

1. Change other configuration options you want to modify\. Options you can change include: 
   + **Debug level**: You can change the debug level from `formatid="fmtinfo"` to `outputs formatid="fmtdebug"`
   + **Log file options**: You can make changes to the log file options, including where the logs are stored, with the exception of the log file names\. 
**Important**  
Do not change the file names or logging will not work correctly\.

     ```
     <rollingfile type="size" filename="/usr/local/sessionmanagerplugin/logs/session-manager-plugin.log" maxsize="30000000" maxrolls="5"/>
     <filter levels="error,critical" formatid="fmterror">
     <rollingfile type="size" filename="/usr/local/sessionmanagerplugin/logs/errors.log" maxsize="10000000" maxrolls="5"/>
     ```
**Important**  
If you use the specified default directory for storing logs, you must either run session commands using sudo or give the directory where the plugin is installed full read and write permissions\. To bypass these restrictions, change the location where logs are stored\.

1. Save the file\.
