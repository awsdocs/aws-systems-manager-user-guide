# Deleting a Change Calendar event<a name="change-calendar-delete-event"></a>

You can delete one event at a time in Change Calendar, a capability in AWS Systems Manager, by using the AWS Management Console\. 

**Tip**  
If you selected **Add change management events to the calendar** when you created the calendar, you can do the following:  
To *temporarily* hide a change management event type from the calendar display, choose the **X** for the type at the top of the monthly preview\.
To *permanently* remove these types from the calendar display, edit the calendar, clear the **Add change management events to the calendar** check box, and then choose **Save**\. Removing the types from the calendar display doesn't delete them from your account\.
