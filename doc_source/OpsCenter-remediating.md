# Remediating OpsItem Issues Using Systems Manager Automation<a name="OpsCenter-remediating"></a>

AWS Systems Manager Automation helps you quickly remediate issues with AWS resources identified in your OpsItems\. Automation uses predefined SSM Automation documents \(runbooks\) to remediate commons issues with AWS resources\. For example, Automation includes runbooks to perform the following actions: 
+ Stop, start, restart, and terminate Amazon Relational Database Service \(Amazon RDS\) and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\) instances\.
+ Create AWS resources such as Amazon Machine Images \(AMIs\), Amazon Elastic Block Store \(Amazon EBS\) snapshots, and Amazon DynamoDB backups\.
+ Configure a resource to use AWS services, including Amazon CloudWatch Events, AWS CloudTrail, and Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\) bucket logging and versioning\.
+ Attach an AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) instance profile to an instance\.
+ Troubleshoot RDP and SSH connectivity issues for EC2 instances\.
+ Reset access for an EC2 instance\.

Each OpsItem in the AWS Management Console includes a **Runbooks** section, as shown in the following\.

![\[A list of Systems Manager Automation runbooks for remediating OpsItem issues\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/images/OpsItems_automation_runbook_list.png)

If the OpsItem was automatically created by CloudWatch, then the list of runbooks is automatically filtered to reflect the *recommended* runbooks for the specific issue\. If the OpsItem was created manually or by specifying OpsItem as a target of a CloudWatch event, then the **Runbooks** section lists all SSM Automation runbooks\.

You can view information about a runbook by either choosing the runbook name in the console or by using the [Systems Manager Automation Document Details Reference](automation-documents-reference-details.md)\.

## Using a Runbook to Remediate an OpsItem Issue<a name="OpsCenter-remediating-how-to"></a>

When you execute a runbook from an OpsItem, you can run a simple version or you can choose the **Advanced configuration** option\. The **Advanced configuration** opens the runbook in Systems Manager Automation, which provides several options for executing the runbook\.

![\[An OpsCenter runbook that uses the Advanced Configuration and opens in Systems Manager Automation\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/images/OpsItems_automation_runbook_advanced.png)

The following procedure describes how to run a simple version of a runbook\. For information about executing an **Advanced configuration** runbook, see [Working with Automation Executions](automation-working.md)\.

**Before You Begin**  
Before you execute a runbook to remediate an OpsItem issue, do the following:
+ Verify that you have permission to run Systems Manager Automation documents\. For more information, see [Getting Started with Automation](automation-setup.md)\.
+ Collect resource\-specific ID information for the runbook that you want to execute\. For example, if you want to execute a runbook that restarts an EC2 instance, then you must specify the ID of the instance to restart\.

**To execute a runbook to remediate an OpsItem issue**

1. Open the AWS Systems Manager console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/systems\-manager/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **OpsCenter**\.

1. Choose the OpsItem ID to open the details page\.

1. Scroll to the **Runbooks** section\.

1. Use the Runbooks Search bar or the numbers in the upper right to find the runbook that you want to execute\.

## Working with Associated Runbooks<a name="OpsCenter-remediating-associated-runbooks"></a>

After you execute a runbook from an OpsItem, the runbook is automatically associated with the related resource of that OpsItem for future reference and easy execution\. Associated runbooks are ranked higher than others in the **Runbooks** list, as shown in the following\.

![\[An associated runbook in an OpsItem\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/images/OpsItems_automation_associated_runbook.png)

Associated runbooks are also available in the **Run automation** list in the **Related resources** section, as shown in the following\.

![\[Using controls to locate an OpsCenter runbook.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/images/OpsItems_automation_associated_runbook_2.png)

Use the following procedure to execute a runbook that has already been associated with a related resource in an OpsItem\. For information about adding related resources, see [Working with OpsItems](OpsCenter-working-with-OpsItems.md)\.

**To execute a resource\-associated runbook to remediate an OpsItem issue**
