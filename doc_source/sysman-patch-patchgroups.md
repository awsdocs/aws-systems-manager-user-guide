# About Patch Groups<a name="sysman-patch-patchgroups"></a>

You can use a *patch group* to associate instances with a specific patch baseline\. Patch groups help ensure that you are deploying the appropriate patches, based on the associated patch baseline rules, to the correct set of instances\. Patch groups can also help you avoid deploying patches before they have been adequately tested\. For example, you can create patch groups for different environments \(such as Development, Test, and Production\) and register each patch group to an appropriate patch baseline\. 

**Note**  
A patch group can only be registered with one patch baseline\.

When you run `AWS-RunPatchBaseline`, you can target managed instances using their instance ID or tags\. SSM Agent and Patch Manager then evaluate which patch baseline to use based on the patch group value that you added to the instance\.

You create a patch group by using Amazon EC2 tags\. Unlike other tagging scenarios across Systems Manager, a patch group *must* be defined with the tag key: **Patch Group**\. Note that the key is case\-sensitive\. You can specify any value, for example "web servers," but the key must be **Patch Group**\.

**Note**  
An instance can only be in one patch group\.

After you create a patch group and tag instances, you can register the patch group with a patch baseline\. Registering the patch group with a patch baseline ensures that the instances within the patch group use the rules defined in the associated patch baseline\. For more information on how to create a patch group and associate the patch group to a patch baseline, see [Create a Patch Group](sysman-patch-group-tagging.md) and [Add a Patch Group to a Patch Baseline](sysman-patch-group-tagging.md#sysman-patch-group-patchbaseline)\.

To view an example of creating a patch baseline and patch groups by using the AWS CLI, see [Tutorial: Patch a Server Environment \(Command Line\)](sysman-patch-cliwalk.md)\. For more information about Amazon EC2 tags, see [Tagging Your Amazon EC2 Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*\.

## How It Works<a name="how-it-works-patch-groups"></a>

When the system runs the task to apply a patch baseline to an instance, SSM Agent verifies that a patch group value is defined for the instance\. If the instance is assigned to a patch group, Patch Manager then verifies which patch baseline is registered to that group\. If a patch baseline is found for that group, Patch Manager notifies SSM Agent to use the associated patch baseline\. If an instance isn't configured for a patch group, Patch Manager automatically notifies SSM Agent to use the currently configured default patch baseline\.

The following diagram shows a general example of the processes that Systems Manager performs when sending a Run Command task to your fleet of servers to patch using Patch Manager\. A similar process is used when a maintenance window is configured to send a command to patch using Patch Manager\.

In this example, we have three groups of Windows EC2 instances with the following tags applied:


****  

| EC2 Instances Group | Tags | 
| --- | --- | 
|  Group 1  |  `key=OS,value=Windows` `key=Patch Group,value=DEV`  | 
|  Group 2  |  `key=OS,value=Windows`  | 
|  Group 3  |  `key=OS,value=Windows` `key=Patch Group,value=QA`  | 

For this example, we also have these two Windows patch baselines:


****  

| Patch Baseline ID | Default | Associated Patch Group | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
|  `pb-0123456789abcdef0`  |  Yes  |  `Default`  | 
|  `pb-9876543210abcdef0`  |  No  |  `DEV`  |

The general process to scan or install patches using Run Command and Patch Manager is as follows:

1. **Send a command to patch**: Use the Systems Manager console, SDK, AWS CLI, or AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell to send a Run Command task using the document `AWS-RunPatchBaseline`\. The diagram shows a Run Command task to patch managed instances by targeting the tag `key=OS,value=Windows`\.

1. **Patch baseline determination**: SSM Agent verifies the patch group tags applied to the EC2 instance and queries Patch Manager for the corresponding patch baseline\.
   + **Matching patch group value associated with patch baseline:**

     1. SSM Agent, which is installed on EC2 instances in group one, receives the command issued in Step 1 to begin a patching operation\. SSM Agent validates that the EC2 instances have the patch group tag\-value `DEV` applied and queries Patch Manager for an associated patch baseline\.

     1. Patch Manager verifies that patch baseline `pb-9876543210abcdef0` has the patch group `DEV` associated and notifies SSM Agent\.

     1. SSM Agent retrieves a patch baseline snapshot from Patch Manager based on the approval rules and exceptions configured in `pb-9876543210abcdef0` and proceeds to the next step\.
   + **No patch group tag added to instance:**

     1. SSM Agent, which is installed on EC2 instances in group two, receives the command issued in Step 1 to begin a patching operation\. SSM Agent validates that the EC2 instances don't have a `Patch Group` tag applied and as a result, SSM Agent queries Patch Manager for the default Windows patch baseline\.

     1. Patch Manager verifies that the default Windows patch baseline is `pb-0123456789abcdef0` and notifies SSM Agent\.

     1. SSM Agent retrieves a patch baseline snapshot from Patch Manager based on the approval rules and exceptions configured in the default patch baseline `pb-0123456789abcdef0` and proceeds to the next step\.
   + **No matching patch group value associated with a patch baseline:**

     1. SSM Agent, which is installed on EC2 instances in group three, receives the command issued in Step 1 to begin a patching operation\. SSM Agent validates that the EC2 instances have the patch group tag\-value `QA` applied and queries Patch Manager for an associated patch baseline\.

     1. Patch Manager does not find a patch baseline that has the patch group `QA` associated\.

     1. Patch Manager notifies SSM Agent to use the default Windows patch baseline `pb-0123456789abcdef0`\.

     1. SSM Agent retrieves a patch baseline snapshot from Patch Manager based on the approval rules and exceptions configured in the default patch baseline `pb-0123456789abcdef0` and proceeds to the next step\.

1. **Patch scan or install**: After determining the appropriate patch baseline to use, SSM Agent begins either scanning for or installing patches based on the operation value specified in Step 1\. The patches that are scanned for or installed are determined by the approval rules and patch exceptions defined in the patch baseline snapshot provided by Patch Manager\.
