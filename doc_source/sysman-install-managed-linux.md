# Step 6: Install SSM Agent for a Hybrid Environment \(Linux\)<a name="sysman-install-managed-linux"></a>

This topic describes how to install SSM Agent on Linux machines in a hybrid environment\. If you plan to use Windows Server machines in a hybrid environment, see the previous step, [Step 5: Install SSM Agent for a Hybrid Environment \(Windows\)](sysman-install-managed-win.md)\.

**Important**  
This procedure is for servers and virtual machines \(VMs\) in an on\-premises or hybrid environment\. To download and install SSM Agent on an Amazon EC2 Linux instance, see [Installing and Configuring SSM Agent on Amazon EC2 Linux Instances](sysman-install-ssm-agent.md)\.

Before you begin, locate the Activation Code and Activation ID that were sent to you after you completed the managed\-instance activation earlier in [Step 4: Create a Managed\-Instance Activation for a Hybrid Environment](sysman-managed-instance-activation.md)\. You specify the Code and ID in the following procedure\.

The URLs in the following scripts let you download SSM Agent from *any* AWS region\. If you want to download the agent from a *specific* region, copy the URL for your operating system, and then replace *region* with an appropriate value\.

*region* represents the identifier for an AWS Region supported by AWS Systems Manager, such as `us-east-2` for the US East \(Ohio\) Region\. For a list of supported *region* values, see the **Region** column in [Systems Manager Service Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/ssm.html#ssm_region) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*\.

For example, to download SSM Agent for Amazon Linux, RHEL, CentOS, and SLES 64\-bit from the US West \(N\. California\) Region \(us\-west\-1\), use the following URL:

```
https://s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/amazon-ssm-us-west-1/latest/linux_amd64/amazon-ssm-agent.rpm
```

------
#### [ Amazon Linux 2, Amazon Linux, RHEL, Oracle Linux, CentOS, and SLES ]

**To install SSM Agent on servers and VMs in your hybrid environment**

1. Log on to a server or VM in your hybrid environment\.

1. Copy and paste one of the following command blocks into SSH\. Replace the placeholder values with the Activation Code and Activation ID generated when you create a managed\-instance activation, and with the identifier of the AWS Region you want to download SSM Agent from\. 

    Note that `sudo` is not necessary if you are a root user\.

   *region* represents the identifier for an AWS Region supported by AWS Systems Manager, such as `us-east-2` for the US East \(Ohio\) Region\. For a list of supported *region* values, see the **Region** column in [Systems Manager Service Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/ssm.html#ssm_region) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*\.

------
#### [ Amazon Linux, RHEL 6\.x, and CentOS 6\.x ]

   ```
   mkdir /tmp/ssm
   curl https://s3.amazonaws.com/ec2-downloads-windows/SSMAgent/latest/linux_amd64/amazon-ssm-agent.rpm -o /tmp/ssm/amazon-ssm-agent.rpm
   sudo yum install -y /tmp/ssm/amazon-ssm-agent.rpm
   sudo stop amazon-ssm-agent
   sudo amazon-ssm-agent -register -code "activation-code" -id "activation-id" -region "region"
   sudo start amazon-ssm-agent
   ```

------
#### [ Amazon Linux 2, RHEL 7\.x, Oracle Linux, and CentOS 7\.x ]

   ```
   mkdir /tmp/ssm
   curl https://s3.amazonaws.com/ec2-downloads-windows/SSMAgent/latest/linux_amd64/amazon-ssm-agent.rpm -o /tmp/ssm/amazon-ssm-agent.rpm
   sudo yum install -y /tmp/ssm/amazon-ssm-agent.rpm
   sudo systemctl stop amazon-ssm-agent
   sudo amazon-ssm-agent -register -code "activation-code" -id "activation-id" -region "region"
   sudo systemctl start amazon-ssm-agent
   ```

------
#### [ SLES ]

   ```
   mkdir /tmp/ssm
   sudo wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/ec2-downloads-windows/SSMAgent/latest/linux_amd64/amazon-ssm-agent.rpm
   sudo rpm --install amazon-ssm-agent.rpm
   sudo systemctl stop amazon-ssm-agent
   sudo amazon-ssm-agent -register -code "activation-code" -id "activation-id" -region "region"
   sudo systemctl enable amazon-ssm-agent
   sudo systemctl start amazon-ssm-agent
   ```

------
#### [ Ubuntu ]
   + **Using \.deb packages**

     ```
     mkdir /tmp/ssm
     curl https://s3.amazonaws.com/ec2-downloads-windows/SSMAgent/latest/debian_amd64/amazon-ssm-agent.deb -o /tmp/ssm/amazon-ssm-agent.deb
     sudo dpkg -i /tmp/ssm/amazon-ssm-agent.deb
     sudo service amazon-ssm-agent stop
     sudo amazon-ssm-agent -register -code "activation-code" -id "activation-id" -region "region" 
     sudo service amazon-ssm-agent start
     ```
   + **Using Snap packages**

     You don't need to specify a URL for the download, because the `snap` command automatically downloads the agent from the [Snap app store](https://snapcraft.io/amazon-ssm-agent) at [https://snapcraft\.io](https://snapcraft.io)\.

     ```
     sudo snap install amazon-ssm-agent --classic
     sudo systemctl stop snap.amazon-ssm-agent.amazon-ssm-agent.service
     sudo /snap/amazon-ssm-agent/current/amazon-ssm-agent -register -code "activation-code" -id "activation-id" -region "region" 
     sudo systemctl start snap.amazon-ssm-agent.amazon-ssm-agent.service
     ```

------
#### [ Debian ]

   ```
   mkdir /tmp/ssm
   wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/ec2-downloads-windows/SSMAgent/latest/debian_amd64/amazon-ssm-agent.deb -O /tmp/ssm/amazon-ssm-agent.deb
   sudo dpkg -i /tmp/ssm/amazon-ssm-agent.deb
   sudo service amazon-ssm-agent stop
   sudo amazon-ssm-agent -register -code "activation-code" -id "activation-id" -region "region" 
   sudo service amazon-ssm-agent start
   ```

------
#### [ Raspbian ]

   ```
   mkdir /tmp/ssm
   sudo curl https://s3.amazonaws.com/ec2-downloads-windows/SSMAgent/latest/debian_arm/amazon-ssm-agent.deb -o /tmp/ssm/amazon-ssm-agent.deb
   sudo dpkg -i /tmp/ssm/amazon-ssm-agent.deb
   sudo service amazon-ssm-agent stop
   sudo amazon-ssm-agent -register -code "activation-code" -id "activation-id" -region "region" 
   sudo service amazon-ssm-agent start
   ```

------
**Note**  
If you see the following error in the SSM Agent error logs, then the machine ID did not persist after a reboot:  
`Unable to load instance associations, unable to retrieve associations unable to retrieve associations error occurred in RequestManagedInstanceRoleToken: MachineFingerprintDoesNotMatch: Fingerprint does not match`  
Run the following command to make the machine ID persist after a reboot\.  

   ```
   umount /etc/machine-id
   systemd-machine-id-setup
   ```

1. Press Enter\.

The command downloads and installs SSM Agent onto the server or VM in your hybrid environment\. The command stops SSM Agent, and then registers the server or VM with the SSM service\. The server or VM is now a managed instance\. Amazon EC2 instances configured for Systems Manager are also managed instances\. In the Amazon EC2 console, however, your on\-premises instances are distinguished from Amazon EC2 instances with the prefix "mi\-"\.

**Note**  
You can deregister a managed instance by calling the [DeregisterManagedInstance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/APIReference/API_DeregisterManagedInstance.html) API action from either the AWS CLI or Tools for Windows PowerShell\. Here's an example CLI command:  

```
aws ssm deregister-managed-instance --instance-id "mi-1234567890"
```
