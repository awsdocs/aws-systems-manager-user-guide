# Canceling a Command<a name="rc-cancel"></a>

You can attempt to cancel a command as long as the service shows that it is in either a Pending or Executing state\. However, even if a command is still in one of these states, we cannot guarantee that the command will be terminated and the underlying process stopped\. 

**To cancel a command using the console**

1. Open the AWS Systems Manager console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/systems\-manager/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Run Command**\.

   \-or\-

   If the AWS Systems Manager home page opens first, choose the menu icon \(![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/images/menu-icon-small.png)\) to open the navigation pane, and then choose **Run Command**\.

1. Select the command invocation that you want to cancel\.

1. Choose **Cancel command**\.

**To cancel a command using the AWS CLI**  
Use the following command\.

```
aws ssm cancel-command --command-id "command  ID" --instance-ids "instance ID"
```
