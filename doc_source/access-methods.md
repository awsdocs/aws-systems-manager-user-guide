# Accessing Systems Manager<a name="access-methods"></a>

You can work with Systems Manager in any of the following ways:

**Systems Manager Console**  
The [AWS Systems Manager console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/) is a browser\-based interface to access and use Systems Manager\.  
Systems Manager functionality was previously available only in the [Amazon EC2 console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\. There you’ll still find Systems Manager features and services in the left navigation pane under the headings **Systems Manager Services** and **Systems Manager Shared Resources**\. However, the Amazon EC2 console offers access to only those Systems Manager features and services released before November 2017\. Systems Manager access through the Amazon EC2 console will be deprecated in the future\. We therefore encourage you to use the [AWS Systems Manager console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/)\. The AWS Systems Manager console offers access to all Systems Manager services, data, and shared resources\. This console also provides access to the dashboards and related services that work with Systems Manager to help you manage your AWS resources\.

**AWS Command Line Tools**  
The AWS command line tools let you issue commands at your system's command line to perform Systems Manager and other AWS tasks, and is supported on Windows, Linux, and macOS\. Using the CLI can be faster and more convenient than using the console\. The command line tools also are useful if you want to build scripts that perform AWS tasks\.   
AWS provides two sets of command line tools: the [AWS Command Line Interface](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) \(AWS CLI\) and the [AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell](https://aws.amazon.com/powershell/)\. For information about installing and using the AWS CLI, see the [AWS Command Line Interface User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/)\. For information about installing and using the Tools for Windows PowerShell, see the [AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/userguide/)\.  
On your Windows Server instances, Windows PowerShell 3\.0 or later is required to run certain SSM documents \(for example, the `AWS-ApplyPatchBaseline` document\)\. Verify that your Windows instances are running Windows Management Framework 3\.0 or later\. The framework includes PowerShell\.

**AWS SDKs**  
AWS provides software development kits \(SDKs\) that consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms \(for example, [Java](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/), [Python](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-python/), [Ruby](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/), [\.NET](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-net/), [iOS and Android](https://aws.amazon.com/mobile/resources/), and [others](https://aws.amazon.com/tools/#sdk)\)\. The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to Systems Manager\. For information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them, see [Tools for Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/tools/#sdk)\.
