# Patch Manager Prerequisites<a name="patch-manager-prerequisites"></a>

**SSM Agent Version**  
Version 2\.0\.834\.0 or later of SSM Agent be running on the instances you want to manage with Patch Manager\.

**Note**  
An updated version of SSM Agent is released whenever new capabilities are added to Systems Manager or updates are made to existing capabilities\. If an older version of the agent is running on an instance, some SSM Agent processes can fail\. For that reason, we recommend that you automate the process of keeping SSM Agent up\-to\-date on your instances\. For information, see [Automate Updates to SSM Agent](ssm-agent-automatic-updates.md)\. To be notified about SSM Agent updates, subscribe to the [SSM Agent Release Notes](https://github.com/aws/amazon-ssm-agent/blob/master/RELEASENOTES.md) page on GitHub\.

**Supported Operating Systems**  
The Patch Manager capability does not support all the same operating systems versions that are supported by other AWS Systems Manager capabilities\. For example, Patch Manager does not support CentOS 6\.3 or Raspbian Stretch\. \(For the full list of Systems Manager\-supported operating systems, see [Systems Manager Prerequisites](systems-manager-prereqs.md)\.\) Therefore, ensure that the instances you want to use with Patch Manager are running one of the operating systems listed in the following table\.
