# Supported operating systems<a name="prereqs-operating-systems"></a>

You can manage Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\) instances, on\-premises servers, and virtual machines \(VMs\), including VMs hosted by other cloud providers, by using AWS Systems Manager\. These nodes must be running one of the following operating systems\.

**Note**  
If you plan to manage and configure AWS IoT Greengrass core devices by using Systems Manager, those devices must meet the requirements for AWS IoT Greengrass\. For more information, see [Setting up AWS IoT Greengrass core devices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/setting-up.html) in the *AWS IoT Greengrass Version 2 Developer Guide*\.  
If you plan to manage and configure AWS IoT and non\-AWS edge devices, those devices must meet the requirements listed here and be configured as on\-premises managed nodes for Systems Manager\. For more information, see [Setting up AWS Systems Manager for edge devices](systems-manager-setting-up-edge-devices.md)\.

**Important**  
Patch Manager, a capability of Systems Manager, might not support all the operating system \(OS\) versions listed in this topic\. For a list of OS versions supported by Patch Manager, see [Patch Manager prerequisites](patch-manager-prerequisites.md)\.

## Windows Server<a name="prereqs-os-windows-server"></a>

SSM Agent requires Windows PowerShell 3\.0 or later to run certain AWS Systems Manager documents \(SSM documents\) on Windows Server instances \(for example, the legacy `AWS-ApplyPatchBaseline` document\)\. Verify that your Windows Server instances are running Windows Management Framework 3\.0 or later\. This framework includes Windows PowerShell\. For more information, see [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=34595&751be11f-ede8-5a0c-058c-2ee190a24fa6=True](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=34595&751be11f-ede8-5a0c-058c-2ee190a24fa6=True)\.

**¹** As of January 14, 2020, Windows Server 2008 is no longer supported for feature or security updates from Microsoft\. Legacy Amazon Machine Images \(AMIs\) for Windows Server 2008 and 2008 R2 still include version 2 of SSM Agent preinstalled, but Systems Manager no longer officially supports 2008 versions and no longer updates the agent for these versions of Windows Server\. In addition, [SSM Agent version 3\.0](ssm-agent-v3.md) might not be compatible with all operations on Windows Server 2008 and 2008 R2\. The final officially supported version of SSM Agent for Windows Server 2008 versions is 2\.3\.1644\.0\.
