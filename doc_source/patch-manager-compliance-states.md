# Understanding patch compliance state values<a name="patch-manager-compliance-states"></a>

The information about patches for a managed node include a report of the state, or status, of each individual patch\.

**Note**  
If you want to assign a specific patch compliance state to a managed node, you can use the [put\-compliance\-items](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ssm/put-compliance-items.html) AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\) command or the [PutComplianceItems](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/APIReference/API_PutComplianceItems.html) API operation\. Assigning compliance state isn't supported in the console\.

Use the information in the following tables to help you identify why a managed node might be out of patch compliance\.

## Patch compliance values for Debian Server, Raspberry Pi OS, and Ubuntu Server<a name="patch-compliance-values-ubuntu"></a>

For Debian Server, Raspberry Pi OS, and Ubuntu Server, the rules for package classification into the different compliance states are described in the following table\.

**Note**  
Keep the following in mind when you're evaluating the **Installed**, **Installed Other**, and **Missing** status values: If you don't select the **Include nonsecurity updates** check box when creating or updating a patch baseline, patch candidate versions are limited to patches included in `trusty-security` \(Ubuntu Server 14\.04 LTS\), `xenial-security` \(Ubuntu Server 16\.04 LTS\), `bionic-security` \(Ubuntu Server 18\.04 LTS\), `focal-security` \(Ubuntu Server 20\.04 LTS\), `groovy-gorilla` \(Ubuntu Server 20\.10 STR\), or `debian-security` \(Debian Server and Raspberry Pi OS\)\. If you do select the **Include nonsecurity updates** check box, patches from other repositories are considered as well\.


| Patch state | Description | Compliance status | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Installed |  The patch is listed in the patch baseline and is installed on the managed node\. It could have been installed either manually by an individual or automatically by Patch Manager when the `AWS-RunPatchBaseline` document was run on the managed node\.  | Compliant | 
| Installed Other |  The patch isn't included in the baseline or isn't approved by the baseline but is installed on the managed node\. The patch might have been installed manually, the package could be a required dependency of another approved patch, or the patch might have been included in an InstallOverrideList operation\. If you don't specify `Block` as the **Rejected patches** action, `Installed_Other` patches also includes installed but rejected patches\.   | Compliant | 
| Installed Pending Reboot |  The Patch Manager `Install` operation applied the patch to the managed node, but the node has not been rebooted since the patch was applied\. \(Note that patches installed outside of Patch Manager are never given a status of `INSTALLED_PENDING_REBOOT`\.\) This typically means the `NoReboot` option was selected for the `RebootOption` parameter when the `AWS-RunPatchBaseline` document was last run on the managed node\. For more information, see [Parameter name: `RebootOption`](patch-manager-aws-runpatchbaseline.md#patch-manager-aws-runpatchbaseline-parameters-norebootoption)\.  | Non\-Compliant | 
| Installed Rejected |  The patch is installed on the managed node but is specified in a **Rejected patches** list\. This typically means the patch was installed before it was added to a list of rejected patches\.  | Non\-Compliant | 
| Missing |  Packages that are filtered through the baseline and not already installed\.  | Non\-Compliant | 
| Failed |  Packages that failed to install during the patch operation\.  | Non\-Compliant | 

## Patch compliance values for other operating systems<a name="patch-compliance-values"></a>

For all operating systems besides Debian Server, Raspberry Pi OS, and Ubuntu Server, the rules for package classification into the different compliance states are described in the following table\. 


|  Patch state | Description | Compliance value | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| INSTALLED |  The patch is listed in the patch baseline and is installed on the managed node\. It could have been installed either manually by an individual or automatically by Patch Manager when the `AWS-RunPatchBaseline` document was run on the node\.  | Compliant | 
| INSTALLED\_OTHER¹ |  The patch isn't in the baseline, but it is installed on the managed node\. The patch might have been installed manually, or the package could be a required dependency of another approved patch\. If you don't specify `Block` as the **Rejected patches** action, `Installed_Other` patches also includes installed but rejected patches\.  | Compliant | 
| INSTALLED\_REJECTED |  The patch is installed on the managed node but is specified in a rejected patches list\. This typically means the patch was installed before it was added to a list of rejected patches\.  | Non\-Compliant | 
| INSTALLED\_PENDING\_REBOOT |  The Patch Manager `Install` operation applied the patch to the managed node \(or a patch was applied to a Windows Server managed node outside of Patch Manager\), but the node hasn't been rebooted since the patch was applied\. \(Note that patches installed outside of Patch Manager are never given a status of `INSTALLED_PENDING_REBOOT`\.\) This typically means the `NoReboot` option was selected for the `RebootOption` parameter when the `AWS-RunPatchBaseline` document was last run on the managed node\. For more information, see [Parameter name: `RebootOption`](patch-manager-aws-runpatchbaseline.md#patch-manager-aws-runpatchbaseline-parameters-norebootoption)\.  | Non\-Compliant | 
| MISSING |  The patch is approved in the baseline, but it isn't installed on the managed node\. If you configure the `AWS-RunPatchBaseline` document task to scan \(instead of install\), the system reports this status for patches that were located during the scan but haven't been installed\.  | Non\-Compliant | 
| NOT\_APPLICABLE¹ | The patch is approved in the baseline, but the service or feature that uses the patch isn't installed on the managed node\. For example, a patch for a web server service such as Internet Information Services \(IIS\) would show NOT\_APPLICABLE if it was approved in the baseline, but the web service isn't installed on the managed node\. A patch can also be marked NOT\_APPLICABLE if it has been superseded by a subsequent update\. This means that the later update is installed and the NOT\_APPLICABLE update is no longer required\. This compliance state is only reported on Windows Server operating systems\.   | Not applicable | 
| FAILED |  The patch is approved in the baseline, but it couldn't be installed\. To troubleshoot this situation, review the command output for information that might help you understand the problem\.  | Non\-Compliant | 

¹ For patches with the state **INSTALLED\_OTHER** and **NOT\_APPLICABLE**, Patch Manager omits some data from query results based on the [describe\-instance\-patches](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ssm/describe-instance-patches.html) command, such as the values for `Classification` and `Severity`\. This is done to help prevent exceeding the data limit for individual nodes in Inventory, a capability of AWS Systems Manager\. To view all patch details, you can use the [describe\-available\-patches](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ssm/describe-available-patches.html) command\.
