# Exporting OpsData from Systems Manager Explorer<a name="Explorer-exporting-OpsData"></a>

When you click a link in Systems Manager Explorer, some pages display OpsData in a list\. These pages include an **Export** button that enables you to export up to 5,000 OpsData items as a comma separated value \(\.csv\) file to an Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\) bucket\. Before you can export data from Explorer pages, you must configure data export as described in this topic\.

![\[Exporting OpsData from Systems Manager Explorer\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/images/explorer-data-export.png)

**Before You Begin**  
When you configure data export, you must specify an Amazon Simple Notification Service \(Amazon SNS\) topic that exists in the same AWS Region where you want to export the data\. Systems Manager sends a notification to the Amazon SNS topic when an export completes\. For information about creating an Amazon SNS topic, see [Tutorial: Creating an Amazon SNS Topic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-tutorial-create-topic.html)\.

Also, be aware that when you export Explorer data, Systems Manager creates an AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) role named `AmazonSSMExplorerExportRole`\. This role uses the following IAM policy\.

```
{
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
          {
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": [
                  "s3:PutObject"
              ],
              "Resource": [
                 "arn:aws:s3:::{{ExportDestinationS3BucketName}}/*"
              ]
          },
          {
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": [
                  "s3:GetBucketAcl"
              ],
              "Resource": [

          {

              "Action": [
                  "sns:Publish"
              ],
              "Resource": [
                  "{{SnsTopicArn}}"
              ]
          },
          {

              ],
              "Resource": [
                  "*"
              ]
          },
          {
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": [
                  "logs:CreateLogGroup",
                  "logs:PutLogEvents",
                  "logs:CreateLogStream"
              ],
              "Resource": [
                  "*"
              ]
          },
          {
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": [
                  "ssm:GetOpsSummary"
              ],
              "Resource": [
                  "*"
              ]
          }
      ]
  }
```

The role includes the following trust entity\.

```
{
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Principal": {
            "Service": "ssm.amazonaws.com"
          },
          "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
      ]
    }
```
