# Step 1: Complete Session Manager prerequisites<a name="session-manager-prerequisites"></a>

Before using Session Manager, make sure your environment meets the following requirements\.


**Session Manager prerequisites**  

| Requirement | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
|  Supported operating systems  |  Session Manager supports connecting to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\) instances, in addition to servers or virtual machines \(VMs\) in your hybrid environment that use the *advanced\-instances* tier\. Session Manager supports the following operating system versions:  Session Manager supports EC2 instances, edge devices, and on\-premises servers and virtual machines \(VMs\) in your hybrid environment that use the *advanced\-instances* tier\. For more information about advanced instances, see [Configuring instance tiers](systems-manager-managed-instances-tiers.md)\.   **Linux**  Session Manager supports all the versions of Linux that are supported by AWS Systems Manager\. For information, see [Systems Manager prerequisites](systems-manager-prereqs.md)\. **macOS** Session Manager supports all the versions of macOS that are supported by AWS Systems Manager\. For information, see [Systems Manager prerequisites](systems-manager-prereqs.md)\.  **Windows**  Session Manager supports Windows Server 2012 through Windows Server 2022\.  Microsoft Windows Server 2016 Nano isn't supported\.   | 
|  SSM Agent  |  At minimum, AWS Systems Manager SSM Agent version 2\.3\.68\.0 or later must be installed on the managed nodes you want to connect to through sessions\.  To use the option to encrypt session data using a key created in AWS Key Management Service \(AWS KMS\), version 2\.3\.539\.0 or later of SSM Agent must be installed on the managed node\.  To use shell profiles in a session, SSM Agent version 3\.0\.161\.0 or later must be installed on the managed node\. To start a Session Manager port forwarding or SSH session, SSM Agent version 3\.0\.222\.0 or later must be installed on the managed node\. To stream session data using Amazon CloudWatch Logs, SSM Agent version 3\.0\.284\.0 or later must be installed on the managed node\. For information about how to determine the version number running on an instance, see [Checking the SSM Agent version number](ssm-agent-get-version.md)\. For information about manually installing or automatically updating SSM Agent, see [Working with SSM Agent](ssm-agent.md)\.  About the ssm\-user account Starting with version 2\.3\.50\.0 of SSM Agent, the agent creates a user account on the managed node, with root or administrator permissions, called `ssm-user`\. \(On versions before 2\.3\.612\.0, the account is created when SSM Agent starts or restarts\. On version 2\.3\.612\.0 and later, `ssm-user` is created the first time a session starts on the managed node\.\) Sessions are launched using the administrative credentials of this user account\. For information about restricting administrative control for this account, see [Turn off or turn on ssm\-user account administrative permissions](session-manager-getting-started-ssm-user-permissions.md)\.   ssm\-user on Windows Server domain controllers Beginning with SSM Agent version 2\.3\.612\.0, the `ssm-user` account isn't created automatically on managed nodes that are used as Windows Server domain controllers\. To use Session Manager on a Windows Server machine being used as a domain controller, you must create the `ssm-user` account manually if it isn't already present, and assign Domain Administrator permissions to the user\. On Windows Server, SSM Agent sets a new password for the `ssm-user` account each time a session starts, so you don't need to specify a password when you create the account\.   | 
|  Connectivity to endpoints  |  The managed nodes you connect to must also allow HTTPS \(port 443\) outbound traffic to the following endpoints: [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-prerequisites.html) Alternatively, you can connect to the required endpoints by using interface endpoints\. For more information, see [Step 6: \(Optional\) Use AWS PrivateLink to set up a VPC endpoint for Session Manager](session-manager-getting-started-privatelink.md)\.  | 
|  AWS CLI  |  \(Optional\) If you use the AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\) to start your sessions \(instead of using the AWS Systems Manager console or Amazon EC2 console\), version 1\.16\.12 or later of the CLI must be installed on your local machine\. You can call `aws --version` to check the version\. If you need to install or upgrade the CLI, see [Installing the AWS Command Line Interface](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html) in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide\. An updated version of SSM Agent is released whenever new capabilities are added to Systems Manager or updates are made to existing capabilities\. Failing to use the latest version of the agent can prevent your managed node from using various Systems Manager capabilities and features\. For that reason, we recommend that you automate the process of keeping SSM Agent up to date on your machines\. For information, see [Automating updates to SSM Agent](ssm-agent-automatic-updates.md)\. Subscribe to the [SSM Agent Release Notes](https://github.com/aws/amazon-ssm-agent/blob/mainline/RELEASENOTES.md) page on GitHub to get notifications about SSM Agent updates\. In addition, to use the CLI to manage your nodes with Session Manager, you must first install the Session Manager plugin on your local machine\. For information, see [Install the Session Manager plugin for the AWS CLI](session-manager-working-with-install-plugin.md)\.  | 
|  Turn on advanced\-instances tier \(hybrid environments\)  |  To connect to on\-premises machines using Session Manager, you must turn on the advanced\-instances tier in the AWS account and AWS Region where you create hybrid activations to register on\-premises machines as managed instances\. There is a charge to use the advanced\-instances tier\. For more information about the advanced\-instance tier, see [Configuring instance tiers](systems-manager-managed-instances-tiers.md)\.  | 
|  Verify IAM service role permissions \(hybrid environments\)  |  Hybrid instances use the AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) service role specified in the hybrid activation to communicate with Systems Manager API operations\. This service role must contain the permissions required to connect to your on\-premises machines using Session Manager\. If your service role contains the AWS managed policy `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore` , the required permissions for Session Manager are already provided\. If you find that the service role does not contain the required permissions, you must deregister the managed instance and register it with a new hybrid activation that uses an IAM service role with the required permissions\. For more information about deregistering managed instances, see [Deregistering managed nodes in a hybrid environment](systems-manager-managed-instances-advanced-deregister.md)\. For more information about creating IAM policies with Session Manager permissions, see [Verify or create an IAM role with Session Manager permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-getting-started-instance-profile.html)\.  |
