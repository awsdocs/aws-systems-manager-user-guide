# Step 1: Complete Session Manager prerequisites<a name="session-manager-prerequisites"></a>

Before using Session Manager, make sure your environment meets the following requirements\.


**Session Manager prerequisites**  

| Requirement | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
|  Supported Operating Systems  |  AWS Session Manager supports the following operating system versions:  Session Manager supports EC2 instances, as well as servers or virtual machines \(VMs\) in your hybrid environment that use the *advanced\-instances* tier\. For more information about advanced instances, see [Enabling the advanced\-instances tier](systems-manager-managedinstances-advanced.md)\.   **Linux**  Session Manager supports all the versions of Linux that are supported for AWS Systems Manager as a whole\. For information, see [Systems Manager prerequisites](systems-manager-prereqs.md)\.  **Windows**  Session Manager supports Windows Server 2008 R2 through Windows Server 2019\.  Microsoft Windows Server 2016 Nano is not supported\.   | 
|  SSM Agent  |  At minimum, SSM Agent version 2\.3\.68\.0 or later must be installed on the instances you want to connect to through sessions\.  To use the option to encrypt session data using a customer master key \(CMK\) created in AWS Key Management Service \(AWS KMS\), version 2\.3\.539\.0 or later of SSM Agent must be installed on the managed instance\.  To start a Session Manager port forwarding or SSH session, version 2\.3\.672\.0 or later of SSM Agent must be installed on the managed instance\. To install or update SSM Agent, see [Working with SSM Agent](ssm-agent.md)\.  About the ssm\-user account Starting with version 2\.3\.50\.0 of SSM Agent, the agent creates a user account on the instance, with root or administrator privileges, called `ssm-user`\. \(On versions before 2\.3\.612\.0, the account is created when SSM Agent starts or restarts\. On version 2\.3\.612\.0 and later, `ssm-user` is created the first time a session starts on the instance\.\) Sessions are launched using the administrative credentials of this user account\. For information about restricting administrative control for this account, see [\(Optional\) Disable or enable ssm\-user account administrative permissions](session-manager-getting-started-ssm-user-permissions.md)\.   ssm\-user on Windows Server domain controllers Beginning with SSM Agent version 2\.3\.612\.0, the `ssm-user` account is not created automatically on managed instances that are used as Windows Server domain controllers\. To use Session Manager on a Windows Server machine being used as a domain controller, you must create the `ssm-user` account manually if it isn't already present\. On Windows Server, SSM Agent sets a new password for the `ssm-user` account each time a session starts, so you do not need to specify a password when you create the account\.   | 
|  AWS CLI  |  \(Optional\) If you use the AWS CLI to start your sessions \(instead of using the AWS Systems Manager console or Amazon EC2 console\), version 1\.16\.12 or later of the CLI must be installed on your local machine\. You can call aws \-\-version to check the version\. If you need to install or upgrade the CLI, see [Installing the AWS Command Line Interface](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html) in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide\. An updated version of SSM Agent is released whenever new capabilities are added to Systems Manager or updates are made to existing capabilities\. If an older version of the agent is running on an instance, some SSM Agent processes can fail\. For that reason, we recommend that you automate the process of keeping SSM Agent up\-to\-date on your instances\. For information, see [Automating updates to SSM Agent](ssm-agent-automatic-updates.md)\. To be notified about SSM Agent updates, subscribe to the [SSM Agent Release Notes](https://github.com/aws/amazon-ssm-agent/blob/master/RELEASENOTES.md) page on GitHub\. In addition, to use the CLI to manage your instances with Session Manager, you must first install the Session Manager plugin on your local machine\. For information, see [\(Optional\) Install the Session Manager Plugin for the AWS CLI](session-manager-working-with-install-plugin.md)\.  |
