# Creating a Resource Data Sync for Configuration Compliance<a name="sysman-compliance-datasync-create"></a>

You can use Systems Manager Resource Data Sync to send compliance data from all of your managed instances to a target Amazon S3 bucket\. When you create the sync, you can specify managed instances from multiple AWS accounts, AWS Regions, and your on\-premises hybrid environment\. Resource Data Sync then automatically updates the centralized data when new compliance data is collected\. With all compliance data stored in a target Amazon S3 bucket, you can use services like Amazon Athena and Amazon QuickSight to query and analyze the aggregated data\. Configuring Resource Data Sync for configuration compliance is a one\-time operation\.

The following graphic shows how Resource Data Sync aggregates all data from different accounts, Regions, and your hybrid environment to a central repository\.

Use the following procedure to create a Resource Data Sync for Configuration Compliance by using the Amazon EC2 console\.

**To create and configure an Amazon S3 Bucket for Resource Data Sync \(console\)**

1. Open the Amazon S3 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/)\.

1. Create a bucket to store your aggregated Inventory data\. For more information, see [Create a Bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/CreatingABucket.html) in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Getting Started Guide*\. Make a note of the bucket name and the AWS Region where you created it\.

1. Open the bucket, choose the **Permissions** tab, and then choose **Bucket Policy**\.

1. Copy and paste the following bucket policy into the policy editor\. Replace *Bucket\-Name* and *Account\-ID* with the name of the Amazon S3 bucket you created and a valid AWS account ID\. Optionally, replace *Bucket\-Prefix* with the name of an Amazon S3 prefix \(subdirectory\)\. If you didn't create a prefix, remove *Bucket\-Prefix*/ from the ARN in the policy\. 

   ```

           {
               "Sid": "SSMBucketPermissionsCheck",
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Principal": {
                   "Service": "ssm.amazonaws.com"
               },
               "Action": "s3:GetBucketAcl",
               "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::Bucket-Name"
           },
           {
               "Sid": " SSMBucketDelivery",
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Principal": {
                   "Service": "ssm.amazonaws.com"
               },
               "Action": "s3:PutObject",
               "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::Bucket-Name/Bucket-Prefix/*/accountid=Account_ID_number/*"],
               "Condition": {
                   "StringEquals": {
                       "s3:x-amz-acl": "bucket-owner-full-control"
                   }
               }
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

**To create a Resource Data Sync**

1. Open the AWS Systems Manager console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/systems\-manager/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Managed Instances**\.

   \-or\-

   If the AWS Systems Manager home page opens first, choose the menu icon \(![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/images/menu-icon-small.png)\) to open the navigation pane, and then choose **Managed Instances**\.

1. Choose **Configure Inventory**, **Resource Data Syncs**, and then choose **Create resource data sync**\.

1. In the **Sync name** field, type a name for the sync configuration\.

1. In the **Bucket name** field, type the name of the Amazon S3 bucket you created at the start of this procedure\.

1. \(Optional\) In the **Bucket prefix** field, type the name of an Amazon S3 bucket prefix \(subdirectory\)\.

1. In the **Bucket region** field, choose **This region** if the Amazon S3 bucket you created is located in the current AWS Region\. If the bucket is located in a different AWS Region, choose **Another region**, and type the name of the Region\.
**Note**  
If the sync and the target Amazon S3 bucket are located in different regions, you may be subject to data transfer pricing\. For more information, see [Amazon S3 Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/)\.

1. Choose **Create**\.
