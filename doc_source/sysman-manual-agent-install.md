# Manually install SSM Agent on EC2 instances for Linux<a name="sysman-manual-agent-install"></a>

Before you manually install AWS Systems Manager Agent \(SSM Agent\) on an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\) Linux operating system, review the following information\.
+ In most cases, SSM Agent is installed, by default, on the following EC2 instances and Amazon Machine Images \(AMIs\):
  + Amazon Linux
  + Amazon Linux 2
  + Amazon Linux 2 ECS\-Optimized Base AMIs
  + SUSE Linux Enterprise Server \(SLES\) 12 and 15
  + Ubuntu Server 16\.04, 18\.04, and 20\.04  
  + Navy Linux Enterprise 

  For information about verifying whether the agent is installed on an EC2 instance, see [Checking SSM Agent status and starting the agent](ssm-agent-status-and-restart.md)\.
+ The manual procedures allow you to install SSM Agent from *any* AWS Region
+ If you need to install the agent on an on\-premises server or a virtual machine \(VM\) so it can be used with Systems Manager, see [Install SSM Agent for a hybrid environment \(Linux\)](sysman-install-managed-linux.md)\.
+ An updated version of SSM Agent is released whenever new capabilities are added to Systems Manager or updates are made to existing capabilities\. If an older version of the agent is running on a managed node, some SSM Agent processes can fail\. For that reason, we recommend that you automate the process of keeping SSM Agent up\-to\-date on your machines\. For information, see [Automating updates to SSM Agent](ssm-agent-automatic-updates.md)\. Subscribe to the [SSM Agent Release Notes](https://github.com/aws/amazon-ssm-agent/blob/mainline/RELEASENOTES.md) page on GitHub to get notifications about SSM Agent updates\.
