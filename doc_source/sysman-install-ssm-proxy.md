# Configure SSM Agent to Use a Proxy for Windows Instances<a name="sysman-install-ssm-proxy"></a>

The information in this topic applies to Windows Server instances created in or after November 2016 that do *not* use the Nano installation option\.

If your instance is a Windows Server 2008\-2012 R2 instance created *before* November 2016, then EC2Config processes Systems Manager requests on your instance\. We recommend that you upgrade your existing instances to use the latest version of EC2Config\. By using the latest EC2Config installer, you install SSM Agent side\-by\-side with EC2Config\. This side\-by\-side version of SSM Agent is compatible with your instances created from earlier Windows AMIs and enables you to use SSM features published after November 2016\. For information about how to install the latest version of the EC2Config service, see [Installing the Latest Version of EC2Config](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/UsingConfig_Install.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Windows Instances*\. If you do not upgrade to the latest version of EC2Config and use EC2Config to process Systems Manager requests, you must configure proxy settings for EC2Config\. For information about configuring EC2Config to use a proxy, see [Configure Proxy Settings for the EC2Config Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/UsingConfig_WinAMI.html#ec2config-proxy)\. 

**To configure SSM Agent to use a proxy**

1. Using Remote Desktop or Windows PowerShell, connect to the instance that you would like to configure to use a proxy\. 

1. Run the following command block in PowerShell\. Replace *hostname* and *port* with the information about your proxy:

   ```
   $serviceKey = "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\AmazonSSMAgent"
   $keyInfo = (Get-Item -Path $serviceKey).GetValue("Environment")
   $proxyVariables = @("http_proxy=hostname:port", "no_proxy=169.254.169.254")
   
   If($keyInfo -eq $null)
   {
   New-ItemProperty -Path $serviceKey -Name Environment -Value $proxyVariables -PropertyType MultiString -Force
   } else {
   Set-ItemProperty -Path $serviceKey -Name Environment -Value $proxyVariables
   }
   Restart-Service AmazonSSMAgent
   ```

After running the preceding command, you can review the SSM Agent logs to confirm the proxy settings were applied\. Entries in the logs look similar to the following\. For more information about SSM Agent logs, see [View SSM Agent Logs](sysman-agent-logs.md)\.

```

**To reset SSM Agent proxy configuration**

1. Using Remote Desktop or Windows PowerShell, connect to the instance to configure\.

1. If you connected using Remote Desktop, launch PowerShell as an administrator\.

1. Run the following command block in PowerShell:

   ```
   Remove-ItemProperty -Path HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\AmazonSSMAgent -Name Environment
   Restart-Service AmazonSSMAgent
   ```

## SSM Agent Proxy Setting Precedence<a name="ssm-agent-proxy-precedence"></a>

When configuring proxy settings for the SSM Agent on Windows instances, it's important to understand these settings are evaluated and applied to the agent configuration when the SSM Agent is started\. How you configure your proxy settings for a Windows instance can determine whether other settings might supersede your desired settings\. SSM Agent proxy settings are evaluated in the following order\.

1. AmazonSSMAgent Registry settings \(`HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\AmazonSSMAgent`\)

1. System environment variables \(http\_proxy, https\_proxy, no\_proxy\)

1. LocalSystem user account environment variables \(http\_proxy, https\_proxy, no\_proxy\)

1. WinHTTP proxy settings

1. Internet Explorer settings

## SSM Agent Proxy Settings and Systems Manager Services<a name="ssm-agent-proxy-services"></a>

If you configured the SSM Agent to use a proxy and are using AWS Systems Manager services, such as Run Command and Patch Manager, that use PowerShell or the Windows Update client during their execution on Windows instances, you must configure additional proxy settings\. Otherwise, the operation might fail because proxy settings used by PowerShell and the Windows Update client are not inherited from the SSM Agent proxy configuration\.

For Run Command, you must configure `WinINet` proxy settings on your Windows instances\. The following PowerShell commands return the current `WinINet` proxy settings, and apply your proxy settings to `WinINet`\.

```
[System.Net.WebRequest]::DefaultWebProxy

$proxyServer = "http://hostname:port"
$proxyBypass = "169.254.169.*"
$WebProxy = New-Object System.Net.WebProxy($proxyServer,$true,$proxyBypass)

[System.Net.WebRequest]::DefaultWebProxy = $WebProxy
```

For Patch Manager, you must configure system\-wide proxy settings so the Windows Update client can scan for and download updates\. We recommend that you use Run Command to run the following commands because they run on the SYSTEM account, and the settings apply system\-wide\. The following netsh commands return the current proxy settings, and apply your proxy settings to the local system\.

```
netsh winhttp show proxy
				
netsh winhttp set proxy hostname:port
```
