# Working with custom patch baselines \(console\)<a name="patch-manager-manage-patch-baselines"></a>

Patch Manager, a capability of AWS Systems Manager, includes a predefined patch baseline for each operating system supported by Patch Manager\. You can use these patch baselines \(you can't customize them\), or you can create your own\. 

The following procedures describe how to create, update, and delete your own custom patch baselines\. To learn more about patch baselines, see [About predefined and custom patch baselines](patch-manager-predefined-and-custom-patch-baselines.md)\.
