# View Session History<a name="session-manager-working-with-view-history"></a>

You can use the AWS Systems Manager console or the AWS CLI to view information about sessions in your account\. In the console, you can view session details such the following:
+ The ID of the session
+ Which user connected to an instance through a session
+ The ID of the instance
+ When the session began and ended
+ The status of the session
+ The location specified for storing session logs \(if enabled\)

Using the AWS CLI, you can view a list of sessions in your account, but not the additional details that are available in the console\.
