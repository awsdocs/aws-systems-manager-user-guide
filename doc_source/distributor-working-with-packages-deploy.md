# Install or Update Packages<a name="distributor-working-with-packages-deploy"></a>

You can use the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI to deploy packages to your AWS Systems Manager managed instances by using AWS Systems Manager Distributor\. You can currently deploy one version of one package per command\. You can install new packages or update existing installations in place\. You can choose to deploy a specific version or choose to always deploy the latest version of a package for deployment\.


| Preference | AWS Systems Manager Action | More Information | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
|  Install or update a package immediately\.  |  Run Command  |  [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/distributor-working-with-packages-deploy.html)  |

|  Automatically install a package on new instances that have a specific tag or set of tags\. For example, installing the Amazon CloudWatch agent on new instances\.  |  State Manager  |  One way to do this is to apply tags to new instances, and then specify the tags as targets in your State Manager association\. State Manager automatically installs the package in an association on instances that have matching tags\.

## Installing or Updating a Package One Time \(Console\)<a name="distributor-deploy-pkg-console"></a>

You can use the AWS Systems Manager console to install or update a package one time\. When you configure a one\-time installation, Distributor uses [AWS Systems Manager Run Command](execute-remote-commands.md) to perform the installation\.

**To install or update a package one time \(console\)**

1. Open the AWS Systems Manager console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/systems\-manager/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Distributor**\.

1. On the Distributor home page, choose the package that you want to install\.

1. For **Packages**, choose **Install one time**\.

   This command opens Systems Manager Run Command with the command document `AWS-ConfigureAWSPackage` and your Distributor package already selected\.

1. For **Document version**, select the version of the `AWS-ConfigureAWSPackage` document that you want to run\.

1. For **Action**, choose **Install**\.

1. For **Installation type**, choose one of the following: 
   + **Uninstall and reinstall**: The package is completely uninstalled, and then reinstalled\. The application is unavailable until the reinstallation completes\.
   + **In\-place update**: Only new or changed files are added to the existing installation according you instructions you provide in an `update` script\. The application remains available throughout the update process

1. For **Name**, verify that the name of the package you selected is entered\.

1. \(Optional\) For **Version**, enter the version name value of the package\. If you leave this field blank, Run Command installs the default version that you selected in Distributor\.

1. In the **Targets** section, identify the instances on which you want to run this operation by specifying tags, selecting instances manually, or specifying a resource group\.
**Note**  
If you choose to select instances manually, and an instance you expect to see is not included in the list, see [Where Are My Instances?](troubleshooting-remote-commands.md#where-are-instances) for troubleshooting tips\.

1. For **Other parameters**:
   + For **Comment**, type information about this command\.
   + For **Timeout \(seconds\)**, specify the number of seconds for the system to wait before failing the overall command execution\. 

1. \(Optional\) For **Rate control**:
   + For **Concurrency**, specify either a number or a percentage of instances on which to run the command at the same time\.
**Note**  
If you selected targets by specifying tags applied to managed instances or by specifying AWS resource groups, and you are not certain how many instances are targeted, then restrict the number of instances that can run the document at the same time by specifying a percentage\.
   + For **Error threshold**, specify when to stop running the command on other instances after it fails on either a number or a percentage of instances\. For example, if you specify three errors, then Systems Manager stops sending the command when the fourth error is received\. Instances still processing the command might also send errors\.

1. \(Optional\) For **Output options**, to save the command output to a file, select the **Write command output to an Amazon S3 bucket** box\. Type the bucket and prefix \(folder\) names in the boxes\.
**Note**  
The S3 permissions that grant the ability to write the data to an S3 bucket are those of the instance profile assigned to the instance, not those of the IAM user performing this task\. For more information, see [Create an IAM Instance Profile for Systems Manager](setup-instance-profile.md)\.

1. In the **SNS notifications** section, if you want notifications sent about the status of the command execution, select the **Enable SNS notifications** check box\.

   For more information about configuring Amazon SNS notifications for Run Command, see [Monitoring Systems Manager Status Changes Using Amazon SNS Notifications](monitoring-sns-notifications.md)\.

1. When you are ready to install the package, choose **Run**\.

1. The **Command status** area reports the progress of the execution\. If the command is still in progress, choose the refresh icon in the top\-left corner of the console until the **Overall status** or **Detailed status** column shows **Success** or **Failed**\.

1. In the **Targets and outputs** area, choose the button next to an instance name, and then choose **View output**\.

   The command output page shows the results of your command execution\. 

1. \(Optional\) If you chose to write command output to an Amazon S3 bucket, choose **Amazon S3** to view the output log data\.

## Scheduling a Package Installation or Update \(Console\)<a name="distributor-deploy-sm-pkg-console"></a>

You can use the AWS Systems Manager console to schedule the installation or update of a package\. When you schedule package installation or update, Distributor uses [AWS Systems Manager State Manager](systems-manager-state.md) to install or update\.

**To schedule a package installation \(console\)**

1. Open the AWS Systems Manager console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/systems\-manager/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Distributor**\.

1. On the Distributor home page, choose the package that you want to install or update\.

1. For **Package**, choose **Install on a schedule**\.

   This command opens Systems Manager State Manager to a new association that is created for you\.

1. For **Name**, enter a name \(for example, **Deploy\-test\-agent\-package**\)\. This is optional, but recommended\. Spaces aren't allowed in the name\.

1. In the **Document** list, the document name `AWS-ConfigureAWSPackage` is already selected\. 

1. For **Action**, verify that **Install** is selected\.

1. For **Installation type**, choose one of the following: 
   + **Uninstall and reinstall**: The package is completely uninstalled, and then reinstalled\. The application is unavailable until the reinstallation completes\.
   + **In\-place update**: Only new or changed files are added to the existing installation according you instructions you provide in an `update` script\. The application remains available throughout the update process\.

1. For **Name**, verify that the name of your package is entered\.

1. For **Version**, if you to want to install a package version other than the latest published version, enter the version identifier\.

1. For **Targets**, choose **Selecting all managed instances in this account**, **Specifying tags**, or **Manually Selecting Instance**\. If you target resources by using tags, enter a tag key and a tag value in the fields provided\.

1. For **Specify schedule**, choose **On Schedule** to run the association on a regular schedule, or **No Schedule** to run the association once\. For more information about these options, see [Create an Association](sysman-state-assoc.md) in this guide\. Use the controls to create a `cron` or rate schedule for the association\.

1. Choose **Create Association**\.

1. On the **Association** page, choose the button next to the association you created, and then choose **Apply association now**\.

   State Manager creates and immediately runs the association on the specified instances or targets\. For more information about the results of running associations, see [Create an Association](sysman-state-assoc.md) in this guide\.

For more information about working with the options in **Advanced options**, **Rate control**, and **Output options**, see [Create an Association](sysman-state-assoc.md)\. 

## Installing a Package One Time \(AWS CLI\)<a name="distributor-deploy-pkg-cli"></a>

You can run send\-command in the AWS CLI to install a Distributor package one time\. If the package is already installed, the application will be taken offline while the package is uninstalled and the new version installed in its place\.

**To install a package one time \(AWS CLI\)**
+ Run the following command in the AWS CLI\.

  ```
  aws ssm send-command --document-name "AWS-ConfigureAWSPackage" --instance-ids "instance-IDs" --parameters '{"action":["Install"],"installationType":["Uninstall and reinstall"],"name":["package-name (in same account) or package-ARN (shared from different account)"]}'
  ```
**Note**  
The default behavior for `installationType` is `Uninstall and reinstall`\. You can omit `"installationType":["Uninstall and reinstall"]` from this command when you are installing a complete package\.

  The following is an example\.

  ```
  aws ssm send-command --document-name "AWS-ConfigureAWSPackage" --instance-ids "i-00000000000000" --parameters '{"action":["Install"],"installationType":["Uninstall and reinstall"],"name":["ExamplePackage"]}'
  ```

For information about other options you can use with the send\-command command, see [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ssm/send-command.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ssm/send-command.html) in the *AWS Systems Manager section of the AWS CLI Command Reference*\.

## Updating a Package One Time \(AWS CLI\)<a name="distributor-update-pkg-cli"></a>

You can run send\-command in the AWS CLI to update a Distributor package without taking the associated application offline\. Only new or updated files in the package are replaced\.

**To update a package one time \(AWS CLI\)**
+ Run the following command in the AWS CLI\.

  ```
  aws ssm send-command --document-name "AWS-ConfigureAWSPackage" --instance-ids "instance-IDs" --parameters '{"action":["Install"],"installationType":["In-place update"],"name":["package-name (in same account) or package-ARN (shared from different account)"]}'
  ```
**Note**  
When you add new or changed files, you must include `"installationType":["In-place update"]` in the command\.

  The following is an example\.

  ```
  aws ssm send-command --document-name "AWS-ConfigureAWSPackage" --instance-ids "i-02573cafcfEXAMPLE" --parameters '{"action":["Install"],"installationType":["In-place update"],"name":["ExamplePackage"]}'
  ```

For information about other options you can use with the send\-command command, see [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ssm/send-command.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ssm/send-command.html) in the *AWS Systems Manager section of the AWS CLI Command Reference*\.

## Scheduling a Package Installation \(AWS CLI\)<a name="distributor-smdeploy-pkg-cli"></a>

You can run create\-association in the AWS CLI to install a Distributor package on a schedule\. The value of `--name`, the document name, is always `AWS-ConfigureAWSPackage`\. The following command uses the key `InstanceIds` to specify target instances\. If the package is already installed, the application will be taken offline while the package is uninstalled and the new version installed in its place\.

```
aws ssm create-association --name "AWS-ConfigureAWSPackage" --parameters '{"action":["Install"],"installationType":["Uninstall and reinstall"],"name":["package-name (in same account) or package-ARN (shared from different account)"]}' --targets [{\"Key\":\"InstanceIds\",\"Values\":[\"instance-ID1\",\"instance-ID2\"]}]
```

**Note**  
The default behavior for `installationType` is `Uninstall and reinstall`\. You can omit `"installationType":["Uninstall and reinstall"]` from this command when you are installing a complete package\.

The following is an example\.

```
aws ssm create-association --name "AWS-ConfigureAWSPackage" --parameters '{"action":["Install"],"installationType":["Uninstall and reinstall"],"name":["Test-ConfigureAWSPackage"]}' --targets [{\"Key\":\"InstanceIds\",\"Values\":[\"i-02573cafcfEXAMPLE\",\"i-0471e04240EXAMPLE\"]}]
```
