# What Is AWS Systems Manager?<a name="what-is-systems-manager"></a>

AWS Systems Manager is an AWS service that you can use to view and control your infrastructure on AWS\. Using the Systems Manager console, you can view operational data from multiple AWS services and automate operational tasks across your AWS resources\. Systems Manager helps you maintain security and compliance by scanning your *managed instances* and reporting on \(or taking corrective action on\) any policy violations it detects\.

A managed instance is a machine that has been configured for use with Systems Manager\. Systems Manager also helps you configure and maintain your managed instances\. Supported machine types include Amazon EC2 instances, on\-premises servers, and virtual machines \(VMs\), including VMs in other cloud environments\. Supported operating system types include Windows Server, multiple distributions of Linux, and Raspbian\.

Using Systems Manager, you can associate AWS resources together by applying the same identifying *resource tag* to each of them\. You can then view operational data for these resources as a *resource group*, to help monitor and troubleshoot\. 

For example, you can assign a resource tag of "`Operation=North Region OS Patching`" to all of the following resources:
+ A group of Amazon EC2 instances
+ A group of on\-premises servers in your own facility
+ A Systems Manager patch baseline that specifies which patches to apply to your managed instances
+ An Amazon S3 bucket to store patching operation log output
+ A Systems Manager *maintenance window* that specifies the schedule for the patching operation

After tagging the resources, you can view a consolidated dashboard in Systems Manager that reports the status of all the resources that are part of the patching operation in your North region\. If a problem arises with any of these resources, you can take corrective action immediately\. 

**Capabilities in Systems Manager**  
Systems Manager is comprised of individual *[capabilities](features.md)*, which are grouped into five categories: *Operations Management*, *Application Management*, *Actions & Change*, *Instances & Nodes*, and *Shared Resources*\.

This collection of capabilities is a powerful set of tools and features that you can use to perform many operational tasks\. For example:
+ Group AWS resources together by any purpose or activity you choose, such as application, environment, region, project, campaign, business unit, or software lifecycle\.
+ Centrally define the configuration options and policies for your managed instances\.
+ Centrally view, investigate, and resolve operational work items related to AWS resources\.
+ Automate or schedule a variety of maintenance and deployment tasks\.
+ Use and create runbook\-style *SSM documents* that define the actions to perform on your managed instances\.
+ Run a command, with rate and error controls, that targets an entire fleet of managed instances\.
+ Securely connect to a managed instance with a single click, without having to open an inbound port or manage SSH keys\.
+ Separate your secrets and configuration data from your code by using *parameters*, with or without encryption, and then reference those parameters from a number of other AWS services\.
+ Perform automated inventory by collecting metadata about your Amazon EC2 and on\-premises managed instances\. Metadata can include information about applications, network configurations, and more\.
+ View consolidated inventory data from multiple AWS Regions and accounts that you manage\.
+ Quickly see which resources in your account are out of compliance and take corrective action from a centralized dashboard\.
+ View active summaries of metrics and alarms for your AWS resources\.

Systems Manager simplifies resource and application management, shortens the time to detect and resolve operational problems, and helps you operate and manage your AWS infrastructure securely at scale\. 

**Note**  
AWS Systems Manager was formerly known as *Amazon Simple Systems Manager \(SSM\)* and *Amazon EC2 Systems Manager \(SSM\)*\. For more information, see [Systems Manager Service Name History](#service-naming-history)\.
