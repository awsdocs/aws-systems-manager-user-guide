# Step 3: Try Systems Manager Tutorials and Walkthroughs<a name="getting-started-walkthroughs"></a>

This topic guides you to tutorials, walkthroughs, and basic tasks to help you learn how to use Systems Manager\.

Because Systems Manager is a collection of several capabilities, no single walkthrough or tutorial can introduce the entire service\. Therefore, we've provided links to resources according to the capability for which they provide practice\.

In most cases, you do not need to complete additional setup or configuration tasks before you start\. You can complete all of the tasks if you have necessary permissions and, where needed, access to one or more managed instances\.

In some cases, additional configuration, setup, or experience with Systems Manager are required before you try a tutorial or walkthrough\. We have identify those tutorials and walkthroughs as "Advanced"\.

**Compliance**  
The [AWS Systems Manager Configuration Compliance](systems-manager-compliance.md) capability scans your fleet of managed instances for patch compliance and configuration inconsistencies\.
+ [Configuration Compliance Walkthrough \(AWS CLI\)](sysman-compliance-walk.md)

**Run Command**  
The [AWS Systems Manager Run Command](execute-remote-commands.md) capability provides you safe, secure remote management of your instances at scale without logging into your servers, replacing the need for bastion hosts, SSH, or remote PowerShell\. It provides a simple way of automating common administrative tasks across groups of instances such as registry edits, user management, and software and patch installations\.

+ [Walkthrough: Use the AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell with Run Command](walkthrough-powershell.md)

**Session Manager**  
The [AWS Systems Manager Session Manager](session-manager.md) capability lets you manage your Amazon EC2 instances through an interactive one\-click browser\-based shell or through the AWS CLI without the need to open inbound ports, maintain bastion hosts, or manage SSH keys\.
+ [Working with Session Manager](session-manager-working-with.md)

**Distributor**  
The [AWS Systems Manager Distributor](distributor.md) capability lets you package your own software—or find AWS\-provided agent software packages, such as AmazonCloudWatchAgent—to install on Systems Manager managed instances\.
+ [Create a Package](distributor-working-with-packages-create.md)

**Patch Manager**  
The [AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager](systems-manager-patch.md) capability helps you select and deploy operating system and software patches automatically across large groups of Amazon EC2 instances or on\-premises servers and VMs\.
+ [Create a Custom Patch Baseline](sysman-patch-baseline-console.md)
+ [Create a Patch Group](sysman-patch-group-tagging.md)
+ [Tutorial: Patch a Server Environment \(Command Line\)](sysman-patch-cliwalk.md)

**Maintenance Windows**  
The [AWS Systems Manager Maintenance Windows](systems-manager-maintenance.md) capability lets you define a schedule for performing potentially disruptive actions on your managed instances, such as patching an operating system, updating drivers, or installing software or patches\.

**Documents**  
The [AWS Systems Manager Documents](sysman-ssm-docs.md) capability lets you create and manage *SSM documents*\. An SSM document defines the actions that Systems Manager performs on your managed instances\. Systems Manager includes more than a dozen pre\-configured documents that you can use by specifying parameters at runtime\. Documents use JavaScript Object Notation \(JSON\) or YAML, and they include steps and parameters that you specify\.
