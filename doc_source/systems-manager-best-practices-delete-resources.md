# Deleting Systems Manager resources and artifacts<a name="systems-manager-best-practices-delete-resources"></a>

As a best practice, we recommend that you delete Systems Manager resources and artifacts if you no longer need to view data about those resources or use the artifacts in any way\. The following table lists each Systems Manager capability or artifact and a link to more information about deleting the resources or artifacts created by Systems Manager\.


****  

| Capability or artifact | Details | 
| --- | --- | 
|  Application Manager  |  You can't delete an application in Application Manager, but you can remove an application from the service by deleting the underlying [tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/APIReference/API_RemoveTagsFromResource.html), [Resource Groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/userguide/deleting-resource-groups.html), or [AWS CloudFormation stacks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-delete-stack.html)\.  | 
|  Automation  |  If you create AWS resources by using Systems Manager Automation, you must manually delete those resources by using the corresponding AWS Management Console\. If you created a custom runbook, you can delete the underlying SSM document\. For more information, see [Deleting custom SSM documents](documents-using.md#deleting-documents)\.  | 
|  Change Calendar  |  You can delete a change calendar and a change calendar event\. For more information, see [Deleting a change calendar](change-calendar-delete.md) and [Deleting a Change Calendar event](change-calendar-delete-event.md)\.  | 
|  Change Manager  |  You can delete a change template\. For more information, see [Deleting change templates](change-templates-delete.md)\.  | 
|  Compliance  |  Systems Manager Compliance automatically displays compliance data about Patch Manager patching and State Manager associations\. You can't delete this data\. If you configured a resource data sync to centralize compliance data in an S3 bucket, you can delete the sync\. For more information, see [Deleting a resource data sync for Compliance](systems-manager-compliance-delete-RDS.md)\.  | 
|  Distributor  |  You can delete packages in Distributor\. For more information, see [Delete a package](distributor-working-with-packages-dpkg.md)\.  | 
|  Explorer  |  You can disconnect from the sources from which Explorer collects OpsData\. For more information, see [Editing Systems Manager Explorer data sources](Explorer-using-editing-data-sources.md)\. You can also delete a resource data sync used by Explorer to aggregate OpsData and OpsItems from multiple AWS Regions and accounts to a single Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\) bucket\. For more information, see [Deleting a Systems Manager Explorer resource data sync](Explorer-using-resource-data-sync-delete.md)\. For information about deleting an S3 bucket, see [Deleting a bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/delete-bucket.html) in the *Amazon Simple Email Service Developer Guide*\.  | 
|  Fleet Manager  |  You can't delete a managed node by using Fleet Manager\. You must use Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\)\. For more information, see [Terminate your instance \(Linux\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/terminating-instances.html) and [Terminate your instance \(Windows\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/terminating-instances.html)\.  | 
|  Inventory  |  You can stop Inventory data collection by deleting the State Manager associations that define the schedule and the resources from which to collect metadata\. For more information, see [Stopping data collection and deleting inventory data](systems-manager-inventory-delete.md)\. If you no longer want to use AWS Systems Manager Inventory to view metadata about your AWS resources, then we also recommend deleting resource data syncs used for inventory data collection\. For more information, see [Deleting an Inventory resource data sync](systems-manager-inventory-delete.md#systems-manager-inventory-delete-RDS)\.  | 
|  Maintenance Windows  |  You can delete a maintenance window, a maintenance window target, and a maintenance window task\. For more information, see [Updating or deleting maintenance window resources \(console\)](sysman-maintenance-update.md)\.  | 
|  OpsCenter  |  You can't manually delete OpsItems from OpsCenter, but you can set the status of one or more OpsItems to **Resolved**\. Systems Manager automatically archives OpsItems after 36 months\. For information about changing the status of an OpsItem see, [Editing an OpsItem](OpsCenter-working-with-OpsItems-editing-details.md)\. For information about bulk resolving OpsItems by using OpsCenter Operational Insights, see [Resolving duplicate OpsItems based on insights](OpsCenter-working-operational-insights.md#OpsCenter-working-operational-insights-resolve)\.  | 
|  Parameter Store  |  You can delete a parameter that you have created\. For more information, see [Deleting Systems Manager parameters](deleting-parameters.md)\.  | 
|  Patch Manager  |  You can delete a custom patch baseline\. For more information, see [Updating or deleting a custom patch baseline \(console\)](patch-manager-update-or-delete-a-patch-baseline.md)\.  | 
|  Quick Setup  |  You can delete associations created by Quick Setup\. The associations are stored and processed by State Manager\. For more information, see [Deleting associations](systems-manager-state-manager-delete-association.md)\.  | 
|  Run Command  |  After a command finishes processing, information about it is stored in the **Command history** tab\. You can't delete information from the **Command history** tab\.  | 
|  Service\-linked role  |  Systems Manager automatically creates service\-linked roles [for some capabilities](using-service-linked-roles.md)\. You can delete these roles\. For more information, see [Deleting the `AWSServiceRoleForAmazonSSM` service\-linked role for Systems Manager](using-service-linked-roles-service-action-1.md#delete-service-linked-role-service-action-1)\.  | 
|  Session Manager  |  Session Manager doesn't retain data about your resources after you terminate a session\. To terminate a session, see [End a session](session-manager-working-with-sessions-end.md)\.  | 
|  SSM Agent  |  You can manually uninstall SSM Agent from your nodes\. For more information, see the following topics\. [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-best-practices-delete-resources.html)  | 
|  State Manager  |  You can delete an association\. For more information, see [Deleting associations](systems-manager-state-manager-delete-association.md)\.  | 
|  Systems Manager document service  |  You can't delete runbooks provided by AWS or AWS Support, but you can delete custom runbooks\. For more information, see [Deleting custom SSM documents](documents-using.md#deleting-documents)\.  |
