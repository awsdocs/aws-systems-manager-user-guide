# Working with patch groups<a name="sysman-patch-group-tagging"></a>

**Important**  
Patch groups are not used in patching operations that are based on *patch policies*\. For more information about working with patch policies, see [Introducing patch policies](patch-policies-about.md)\.

To help you organize your patching efforts, we recommend that you add managed nodes to patch groups by using tags\. Patch groups require use of the tag key `Patch Group` or `PatchGroup`\. `PatchGroup` \(without a space\) is required if you have [allowed tags in EC2 instance metadata](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.html#allow-access-to-tags-in-IMDS)\. You can specify any tag value, but the tag key must be `Patch Group` or `PatchGroup`\. For more information about patch groups, see [About patch groups](sysman-patch-patchgroups.md)\.

After you group your managed nodes using tags, you add the patch group value to a patch baseline\. By registering the patch group with a patch baseline, you ensure that the correct patches are installed during the patching operation\.

+ [Task 3: Add a patch group to a patch baseline](#sysman-patch-group-patchbaseline)

## Task 1: Add EC2 instances to a patch group using tags<a name="sysman-patch-group-tagging-ec2"></a>

For Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\) instances, you can add tags by using any of the following:
+ The AWS Systems Manager console
+ The Amazon EC2 console
+ The AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\) command `[create\-tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ssm/create-tags.html)`
+ The Systems Manager API operation `[CreateTags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/APIReference/API_CreateTags.html)`

**Important**  
You can't apply the `Patch Group` tag \(with a space\) to an Amazon EC2 instance if the **Allow tags in instance metadata** option is enabled on the instance\. Allowing tags in instance metadata prevents tag key names from containing spaces\. If you have [allowed tags in EC2 instance metadata](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.html#allow-access-to-tags-in-IMDS), you must use the tag key `PatchGroup` \(without a space\)\.

**To add EC2 instances to a patch group \(Systems Manager console\)**

1. Open the AWS Systems Manager console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/systems\-manager/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Fleet Manager**\.

   \-or\-

   If the AWS Systems Manager home page opens first, choose the menu icon \(![\[The menu icon\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/images/menu-icon-small.png)\) to open the navigation pane, and then choose **Fleet Manager** in the navigation pane\.

1. In the **Managed instances** list, choose the ID of a managed EC2 instance that you want to configure for patching\.
**Note**  
When using the Amazon EC2 console and AWS CLI, it's possible to apply `Key = Patch Group` or `Key = PatchGroup` tags to instances that aren't yet configured for use with Systems Manager\.  
If a managed node you expect to see isn't listed, see [Troubleshooting managed node availability](troubleshooting-managed-instances.md) for troubleshooting tips\.

1. Choose the **Tags** tab, then choose **Edit**\.

1. In the left column, enter **Patch Group** or **PatchGroup**\. If you have [allowed tags in EC2 instance metadata](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.html#allow-access-to-tags-in-IMDS), you must use `PatchGroup` \(without a space\)\.

1. In the right column, enter a tag value to serve as the name for this patch group\.

1. Choose **Save**\.

1. Repeat this procedure to add other managed instances to the same patch group\.

**To add EC2 instances to a patch group \(Amazon EC2 console\)**

1. Open the [Amazon EC2 console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/), and then choose **Instances** in the navigation pane\. 

1. In the list of instances, choose an instance that you want to configure for patching\.

1. In the **Actions** menu, choose **Instance settings**, **Manage tags**\.

1. Choose **Add new tag**\.

1. For **Key**, enter **Patch Group** or **PatchGroup**\. If you have [allowed tags in EC2 instance metadata](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.html#allow-access-to-tags-in-IMDS), you must use `PatchGroup` \(without a space\)\.

1. For **Value**, enter a value to serve as the name for this patch group\.

1. Choose **Save**\.

1. Repeat this procedure to add other instances to the same patch group\.

## Task 2: Add managed nodes to a patch group using tags<a name="sysman-patch-group-tagging-managed"></a>

For AWS IoT Greengrass core devices and hybrid managed nodes \(mi\-\*\), you can add tags by using any of the following:
+ The Systems Manager console
+ The AWS CLI command `[add\-tags\-to\-resource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ssm/add-tags-to-resource.html)`
+ The Systems Manager API operation `[AddTagsToResource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/APIReference/API_AddTagsToResource.html)`

 You can't add tags for hybrid managed nodes using the Amazon EC2 console\.

**To add managed nodes to a patch group \(Systems Manager console\)**

1. Open the AWS Systems Manager console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/systems\-manager/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Fleet Manager**\.

   \-or\-

   If the AWS Systems Manager home page opens first, choose the menu icon \(![\[The menu icon\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/images/menu-icon-small.png)\) to open the navigation pane, and then choose **Fleet Manager** in the navigation pane\.

1. In the **Managed nodes** list, choose the name of the managed node that you want to configure for patching\.
**Note**  
If a managed node you expect to see isn't listed, see [Troubleshooting managed node availability](troubleshooting-managed-instances.md) for troubleshooting tips\.

1. Choose the **Tags** tab, then choose **Edit**\.

1. In the left column, enter **Patch Group** or **PatchGroup**\. If you have [allowed tags in EC2 instance metadata](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.html#allow-access-to-tags-in-IMDS), you must use `PatchGroup` \(without a space\)\.

1. In the right column, enter a tag value to serve as the name for this patch group\.

1. Choose **Save**\.

1. Repeat this procedure to add other managed nodes to the same patch group\.

## Task 3: Add a patch group to a patch baseline<a name="sysman-patch-group-patchbaseline"></a>

To associate a specific patch baseline with your managed nodes, you must add the patch group value to the patch baseline\. By registering the patch group with a patch baseline, you can ensure that the correct patches are installed during a patching operation\. For more information about patch groups, see [About patch groups](sysman-patch-patchgroups.md)\.

**Note**  
The steps you follow depend on whether you first accessed Patch Manager before or after the [patch policies](patch-policies-about.md) release on December 22, 2022\.

**To add a patch group to a patch baseline \(Systems Manager console\)**

1. Open the AWS Systems Manager console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/systems\-manager/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Patch Manager**\.

1. If you're accessing Patch Manager for the first time in the current AWS Region and the Patch Manager start page opens, choose **Start with an overview**\.

1. Choose the **Patch baselines** tab, and then in the **Patch baselines** list, choose the patch baseline that you want to configure for your patch group\.

   If you didn't first access Patch Manager until after the patch policies release, you must choose a custom baseline that you have created\.

1. If you already used Patch Manager before the patch policies release: 
   + Choose **Actions**, then **Modify patch groups**\.
   + Enter the tag *value* you added to your managed nodes in [Task 2: Add managed nodes to a patch group using tags](#sysman-patch-group-tagging-managed), then choose **Add**\.

   If you began using Patch Manager after the patch policies release:
   + In the **Tags** section near the bottom of the page, choose **Edit tags**, and then choose **Add tags**\.
   + For **Key**, enter **Patch Group** or **PatchGroup**\. If you have [allowed tags in EC2 instance metadata](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.html#allow-access-to-tags-in-IMDS), you must use `PatchGroup` \(without a space\)\.
   + For **Value**, enter the tag value you added to your managed nodes in [Task 2: Add managed nodes to a patch group using tags](#sysman-patch-group-tagging-managed), then choose **Save changes**\.
